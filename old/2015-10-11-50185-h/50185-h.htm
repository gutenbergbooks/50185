<p>The Volunteer movement was well shown in a print by
A.&nbsp;M., November 1803: ‘Boney attacking the English
Hives, or the Corsican caught at last in the Island.’ There
are many hives, the chief of which has a royal crown on
its top, and is labelled ‘Royal London Hive. Threadneedle
Street Honey’&mdash;which Napoleon is attacking, sword
in hand. George the Third, as Bee Master, stands behind
the hives, and says, ‘What! what! you plundering little
Corsican Villain, have you come to rob my industrious
Bees of their Honey? I won’t trust to your oath. Sting,
Sting the Viper to the heart my good Bees, let Buz, Buz
be the Word in the Island.’ The bees duly obey their
master’s request, and come in clouds over Napoleon, who
has to succumb, and pray, kneeling, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>‘Curse those Bees
they sting like Scorpions. I did not think this Nation of
Shopkeepers could sting so sharp. Pray good Master of
the Bees, do call them off, and I will swear by all the three
creeds which I profess, Mahometan, Infidel, and Christian,
that I will never disturb your Bees again.’</p>

<p>‘Selling the Skin before the Bear is caught, or cutting
up the Bull before he is killed,’ is by I. Cruikshank
(December 21, 1803), and represents a Bull reposing calmly
on the English shore, whilst on the opposite or French
coast is Bonaparte, Talleyrand, and several Generals.
Bonaparte, pointing to the Bull, says: ‘I shall take the
Middle part, because it contains the Heart and Vitals&mdash;Talley,
you may take the head, because you have been
accustomed to take the Bull by the horns.’ Britannia
stands, fully armed, behind the Bull, by an ‘alarm post,’ on
which hangs a bell, ‘British Valor,’ which she is preparing to
ring: ‘When these Mounseers have settled their plan, I will
just rouse the Bull, and then see who will be cut up first.’</p>

<p>‘New Bellman’s Verses for Christmas 1803!’ is an
extremely inartistic work of an unknown man (December
1803); the only thing worth quoting about it are these
<span class="locked">verses:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>‘More than expected, or too many for Boney’ (artist
unknown, December 1803), shows him as an Ass, on whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
back is John Bull, Russia, Prussia, and Germany. Says
Russia, ‘We all depend upon you Mr. Bull&mdash;give him a
little more spurring, and we’ll soon make him feel the
Rowels.’ John mildly expostulates with his quadruped:
‘Come&mdash;come, don’t be sulky&mdash;if you won’t go in a snaffle,
you must be forced to go in a curb.’</p>

<p>Dean Swift’s immortal book did yeoman’s service to
the caricaturists, and we find it again employed in a print
by West, December 1803: ‘The Brobdingnag Watchman
preventing Gulliver’s landing.’ It is very feeble, and merely
consists of George the Third as a watchman turning the
light of the ‘Constitutional Lanthorn’ upon Bonaparte and
his companions, who are attempting a landing.</p>

<p>Another print, by West (December 1803), shows ‘Mr.
and Mrs. Bull giving Buonaparte a Christmas Treat!’
The latter is bound to a post in sight of, but beyond reach
of, the national fare of this festival. John Bull says, holding
up a piece of beef, in derision, ‘Yes, yes&mdash;the Beef is
very good, so is the pudding too&mdash;but the deuce a morsel
do you get of either, Master Boney.’ Mrs. Bull too, who is
drinking from a frothing tankard, says: ‘Your health
Master Boney, wishing you a merry Christmas,’ but offers
him none.</p>

<p>An unknown artist gives an undated picture of ‘a Cock
and Bull Story.’ Napoleon, as the Gallic Cock, on his side
of the Channel, sings</p>

<p>Should the Modern <i>Tamerlane</i> revive the tragedy of <i>England
Invaded</i>, and, in the progress of his <i>Wild goose Chace</i>, escape the

who will tear off <i>the Mask</i>, under which <i>the Hypocrite</i>, this <i>Fool of

he, to <i>a Wonder</i>, attempt a <i>Trip to Scarborough</i>, to set them <i>all

assuredly meet a <i>Chapter of Accidents</i> on his <i>Road to Ruin</i>; for
<i>Britannia and the Gods are in Council</i>, to make him a <i>Castle
Spectre</i>: he will, too late, discover <i>the Secret</i> of <i>Who’s the Dupe</i>;
and that it is <i>the Custom of the Country</i> of <i>John Bull</i>, to shew <i>the
Devil to pay</i> to any <i>Busybody</i>, who seeks to enforce on us <i>Reformation</i>.</p>

<p>This <i>Double Dealer</i>, who has excited dismay <i>Abroad and at

has achieved, still presumes, by <i>the Wheel of Fortune</i>, like another

renewing the distressing scenes of <i>the Siege of Damascus</i>; until
amongst the desolated ruins of our City, he should establish himself
like <i>a London Hermit</i>. That <i>he Would if he Could</i>, is past
all doubt; but if he will take <i>a Word to the Wise</i>, from <i>a Man
of the World</i>, he will believe <i>He’s much to blame</i>, and <i>All in the

<p><i>The Poor Soldier</i>, whose generous heart expands to render

either field, and prepared to give <i>Measure for Measure</i>; and to
convert the <i>Agreeable Surprize</i>, which the Acre <i>Runaway</i> anticipates
in <i>the Camp</i>, from <i>the Beaux Stratagem</i> into <i>a Tale of

<p>The year 1804 was a most eventful one for Napoleon.
With all his hatred of England, and his wish for her invasion,
he was powerless in that matter, and had plenty to
employ him at home. The English had got used to their
bugbear the flotilla, and the caricaturist had a rest. Napoleon
had his hands full. First and foremost was that conspiracy
against his life and government, in which Georges
Cadoudal, Moreau, and Pichegru figure so prominently, and
which entailed the execution of the Duc d’Enghien.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Bourbon house he so detested,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had the Duke d’Enghien arrested;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sort of trial then took place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sentence passed&mdash;the usual case.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis said that Boney chose a spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the gallant fellow shot.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Whatever may have been Napoleon’s conduct in this affair,
these two last lines are undoubtedly false. The duke had
been residing at Ettenheim, in the duchy of Baden, and
was thought to be there in readiness to head the Royalists
in case of need, that his hunting was but a pretext to cover
flying visits to Paris, and that he was the person whom
Georges Cadoudal and his fellow conspirators always received
bareheaded. He was seized, brought to Paris, and
lodged in the Château de Vincennes. A few hours’ rest,
and he was roused at midnight to go before his judges.
It was in vain he pleaded the innocence of his occupations,
and begged to have an interview with the First Consul;
yet he declared he had borne arms against France, and his
wish to serve in the war on the English side against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
France; and owned that he received a pension of one
hundred and fifty guineas a month from England. He
was found guilty and condemned to death, and two hours
afterwards was led out into the ditch of the fortress, and
there shot, a priest being refused him. O’Meara, describing
a conversation with Napoleon on this subject, says: ‘I
now asked if it were true that Talleyrand had retained
a letter written by the Duc d’Enghien to him until two
days after the duke’s execution? Napoleon’s reply was,
“It is true; the duke had written a letter offering his
services, and asking a command in the Army from me,
which that <i>scelerato</i>, Talleyrand, did not make known until
two days after his execution.” I observed that Talleyrand,
by his culpable concealment of the letter, was virtually
guilty of the death of the duke. “Talleyrand,” replied
Napoleon, “is a <i>briccone</i>, capable of any crime. I,” continued
he, “caused the Duc d’Enghien to be arrested in
consequence of the Bourbons having landed assassins in
France to murder me. I was resolved to let them see that
the blood of one of their princes should pay for their
attempts, and he was accordingly tried for having borne
arms against the republic, found guilty, and shot, according
to the existing laws against such a crime.”’</p>

<p>Ansell (June 2, 1804) gives us ‘The Cold Blooded
Murderer, or the Assassination of the Duc d’Enghien,’ in
which the duke is represented as being bound to a tree, a
soldier on either side holding a torch, whilst Napoleon is
running his sword into his heart. D’Enghien bravely cries
out, ‘Assassin! your Banditti need not cover my Eyes, I
fear not Death, tho’ perhaps a guiltless countenance may
appall your bloodthirsty soul.’ Napoleon, whilst stabbing
his victim, says: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>‘Now de whole World shall know de
courage of de first grand Consul, dat I can kill my enemies
in de Dark, as well as de light, by Night as well as by
Day,&mdash;dare&mdash;and dare I had him&mdash;hark, vat noise was dat?
ah! ’tis only de Wind&mdash;dare again, and dare&mdash;Now I shall
certainly be made Emperor of de Gulls.’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Devils are rejoicing
over the deed, and are bearing a crown. They say:
‘This glorious deed does well deserve a Crown, thus let
us feed his wild ambition, untill some bold avenging hand
shall make him all our own.’</p>

<p>A Captain Wright figures in this plot; and, as he was
an Englishman, and his name is frequent both in the
caricature and satire of the day, some notice of him must
be given. He was a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and
somehow got mixed up with this conspiracy. He took
Georges Cadoudal and others on board either at Deal or
Hastings, and crossed over to Beville, where there was a
smuggler’s rope let down from an otherwise inaccessible cliff.
By means of this they were drawn up, and went secretly
to Paris. The plot failed, and they were thrown into
prison, Wright being afterwards captured at sea. Cadoudal
went to the scaffold, Pichegru was found strangled in his
cell; and Wright, the English said, after being tortured in
prison, to compel him to give evidence against his companions,
was assassinated by order of Napoleon.</p>

<p>The latter, however, always indignantly denied it, saying
that Captain Wright committed suicide. In O’Meara’s
book he denies it several times, and an extract or two will
be worth noting. ‘In different nights of August, September,
and December 1803 and January 1804, Wright landed
Georges, Pichegru, Rivière, Costa, St. Victor, La Haye,
St. Hilaire, and others at Beville. The four last named
had been accomplices in the former attempt to assassinate
me by means of the infernal machine, and most of the rest
were well known to be chiefs of the Chouans,’ &amp;c. ‘There
was something glorious in Wright’s death. He preferred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
taking away his own life, to compromising his government.’
‘Napoleon in very good spirits. Asked many questions
about the horses that had won at the races, and the manner
in which we trained them; how much I had won or lost;
and about the ladies, &amp;c. “You had a large party yesterday,”
continued he. “How many bottles of wine? Drink,
your eyes look like drink,” which he expressed in English.
“Who dined with you?” I mentioned Captain Wallis
amongst others. “What! is that the lieutenant who was
with Wright?” I replied in the affirmative. “What does
he say about Wright’s death?” I said, “He states his
belief that Wright was murdered by orders of Fouché, for
the purpose of ingratiating himself with you. That six or
seven weeks previous, Wright had told him that he expected
to be murdered like Pichegru, and begged of him
never to believe that he would commit suicide; that he
had received a letter from Wright, about four or five weeks
before his death, in which he stated that he was better
treated, allowed to subscribe to a library, and to receive
newspapers.” Napoleon replied, “I will never allow that
Wright was put to death by Fouché’s orders. If he was
put to death privately, it must have been by my orders,
and not by those of Fouché. Fouché knew me too well.
He was aware that I would have had him hanged directly,
if he attempted it. By this officer’s own words, Wright
was not <i>au secret</i>, as he says he saw him some weeks before
his death, and that he was allowed books and newspapers.
Now, if it had been in contemplation to make away with
him, he would have been put <i>au secret</i> for months before,
in order that people might not be accustomed to see him
for some time previous, as I thought this * * * intended
to do in November last. Why not examine the gaolers
and turnkeys? The Bourbons have every opportunity of
proving it, if such really took place. But your ministers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
themselves do not believe it. The idea I have of what
was my opinion at that time about Wright, is faint; but,
as well as I can recollect, it was that he ought to have
been brought before a military commission, for having
landed spies and assassins, and the sentence executed
within forty-eight hours. What dissuaded me from doing
so, I cannot clearly recollect. Were I in France at this
moment, and a similar occurrence took place, the above
would be my opinion, and I would write to the English
Government: ‘Such an officer of yours has been tried for
landing brigands and assassins on my territories. I have
caused him to be tried by a military commission. He has
been condemned to death. The sentence has been carried
into execution. If any of my officers in your prisons have
been guilty of the same, try, and execute them. You have
my full permission and acquiescence. Or, if you find,
hereafter, any of my officers landing assassins on your
shores, shoot them instantly.’”’</p>

<p>The most important event of the year to Napoleon himself,
was his being made Emperor. Although First Consul
for life, with power to appoint his successor, it did not
satisfy his ambition. He would fain be Emperor, and that
strong will, which brooked no thwarting, took measures to
promote that result. In the Senate M. Curée moved, ‘that
the First Consul be invested with the hereditary power,
under the title of Emperor,’ and this motion was but feebly
fought against by a few members, so that at last an address
was drawn up, beseeching Napoleon to yield to the wishes
of the nation. A <i>plébiscite</i> was taken on the subject, with
the result that over three millions and a half people voted
for it, and only about two thousand against it. On May 18,
Cambacérès, at the head of the Senate, waited upon Napoleon,
at St. Cloud, with an address detailing the feelings
and wishes of the nation. It is needless to say that
Napoleon ‘accepted the Empire, in order that he might
labour for the happiness of the French.’</p>

<p>The flotilla, on the other side of the Channel, was still
looked upon with uneasiness, and watched with jealous
care. Still, we find that it was only at the commencement
of the year that it was caricatured, Napoleon’s being
made Emperor proving a more favourite subject; and,
besides, a feeling sprung up that there was not much mischief
in it.</p>

<p>One of the most singular caricatures, in connection with
the projected invasion, that I have met with is by Ansell,
January 6, 1804. ‘The Coffin Expedition, or Boney’s Invincible
Armada Half seas over.’ The flotilla is here
represented as gunboats, in the shape of coffins: all the
crews, naval and military, wearing shrouds; whilst at the
masthead of each vessel is a skull with <i>bonnet rouge</i>. It
is needless to say they are represented as all foundering,
one man exclaiming, ‘Oh de Corsican Bougre was make
dese Gun boats on purpose for our Funeral.’ Some British
vessels are in the mid distance, and two tars converse thus:
‘I say Messmate, if we dont bear up quickly, there will be
nothing left for us to do.’ ‘Right, Tom, and I take them
there things at the Masthead to be Boney’s Crest, a skull
without brains.’</p>

<p>‘Dutch Embarkation; or Needs must when the Devil
drives!!’ (artist unknown, January 1804) represents Bonaparte,
with drawn sword, driving fat, solid Dutchmen each
into a gun-boat about as big as a walnut-shell. One remonstrates:
‘D&mdash;n such Liberty, and D&mdash;n such a Flotilla!!
I tell you we might as well embark in Walnut Shells.’ But
Bonaparte replies: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>‘Come, come, Sir, no grumbling, I insist
on your embarking and destroying the modern Carthage&mdash;don’t
you consider the liberty you enjoy&mdash;and the grand
flotilla that is to carry you over!’</p>

<p>As good a one as any of Gillray’s caricatures is the
King of Brobdingnag and Gulliver, February 10, 1804&mdash;scene,
‘Gulliver manœuvring with his little boat in the
cistern.’ The king and queen (excellent likenesses) and
two princesses are looking on at Bonaparte sailing, whilst
the young princes are blowing, to make a wind for him.
Lord Salisbury stands behind the royal chair, and beefeaters
and ladies of the court complete the scene. This,
however, is specially described as ‘designed by an amateur,
etched by Gillray.’</p>

  <div class="caption">THE KING OF BROBDINGNAG AND GULLIVER.</div></div>

<p>‘A French Alarmist, or John Bull looking out for the
Grand Flotilla!!’ (West, March 1804.) He is on the
coast, accompanied by his bull-dog, and armed with a
sword, looking through a telescope. Behind him is a
Frenchman, who is saying, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>‘Ah! Ah! Monsieur Bull,&mdash;dere
you see our Grande flotilla&mdash;de grande gon boats&mdash;ma
foi&mdash;dere you see em sailing for de grand attack on your
nation&mdash;dere you see de Bombs and de Cannons&mdash;Dere
you see de Grande Consul himself at de head of his Legions.
Dere you see&mdash;&mdash;’ But John Bull replies, ‘Mounseer,
all this I cannot see&mdash;because ’tis not in sight.’</p>

<p>We now come to the caricatures relating to the Empire.</p>

<p>A print, attributed to Rowlandson (May 1804?), shows
‘A Great Man on his Hobby Horse, a design for an Intended
Statue on the Place la Liberté at Paris.’ Napoleon
is riding <i>the high horse</i> ‘Power,’ which prances on a Globe.</p>

<p>‘A new French Phantasmagoria’ is by an unknown
artist (May 1804). John Bull cannot realise the fact of
Napoleon being Emperor, but stares at him through an
enormous pair of spectacles. ‘Bless me, what comes here&mdash;its
time to put on my large spectacles, and tuck up my
trowsers. Why, surely, it can’t be&mdash;it is Bonny too, for all
that. Why what game be’st thee at now? acting a play
mayhap. What hast thee got on thy head there? always
at some new freak or other.’ Bonaparte, in imperial robes,
and with crown and sceptre, holds out his hand, and
says: ‘What! my old Friend, Mr. Bull, don’t you know
me?’</p>

<p>Ansell gives us (May 28, 1804) ‘The Frog and the Ox,
or The Emperor of the <i>Gulls</i> in his stolen gear.’ Napoleon,
very small, is depicted as capering about in imperial
robes, with an enormous crown made of coins, daggers,
and a cup of poison; his sceptre has for its top a guillotine.
George the Third is regarding him through his glass.
Napoleon says, ‘There Brother! there! I shall soon be as
Big as you, it’s a real Crown, but it’s cursed heavy, my Head
begins to ache already. I say Can’t we have a grand meeting
like Henry the 8th and Francis the 1st?’ King George
cannot quite make out the mannikin. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>‘What have we got
here, eh? A fellow that has stolen some Dollars, and
made a Crown of them, eh? and then wants to pass them
off for Sterling; it won’t go, it won’t pass Fellow.’ Beside
the King is a bull, and behind Napoleon is a frog, who is
trying to swell to the bull’s proportions, whilst John Bull
laughingly remarks, ‘Dang it, why a looks as tho a’d burst:
a’l nerr be zo big as one of our Oxen tho.’</p>

<p>‘Injecting blood Royal, or Phlebotomy at St. Cloud,’
shews Napoleon, in his new phase of power, having the
blood of a Royal Tiger infused into his veins. He says,
‘It’s a delightful operation! I feel the Citizenship oozing
out at my fingers’ ends.&mdash;let all the family be plentifully
supplied! Carry up a Bucket full to the Empress immediately!!!’</p>

<p>In June 1804 I. Cruikshank drew a picture called ‘the
Right Owner.’ Louis the Eighteenth appears to Napoleon,
and, pointing to his crown, says, ‘That’s Mine.’ Napoleon,
who is seated on his throne, armed with sword, pistols, and
dagger, shrinks back in violent alarm, exclaiming, ‘Angels
and Ministers of Grace defend me.’</p>

<p>‘A Proposal from the New Emperor’ is a caricature
by Ansell (July 9, 1804). He comes, cap, or rather crown,
in hand, to John Bull, saying, ‘My Dear Cousin Bull&mdash;I
have a request to make you&mdash;the good people whom I
govern, have been so lavish of their favors towards me&mdash;that
they have exhausted every title in the Empire&mdash;therefore,
in addition, I wish you to make me a Knight of
Malta.’ John Bull replies, ‘I’ll see you d&mdash;d first!! You
know I told you so before.’</p>

<p>‘The Imperial Coronation’ is a very inartistic sketch
by an unknown artist (July 31, 1804). Napoleon is being
crowned by the Pope, who says, ‘In a little time you shall
see him, and in a little time you shall not see him,’ and
then lets down the crown, with cruel force, by a rope and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
pulley from the gibbet from which it has been suspended.
Its weight crushes him through the platform on which he
has been sitting, and he exclaims, ‘My dear Talleyrand,
save me; My throne is giving way. I am afraid the foundation
is rotten, and wants a deal of mending.’ Talleyrand
sympathisingly answers, ‘Oh, Master, Master, the Crown
is too heavy for you.’</p>

<p>I. Cruikshank drew ‘Harlequin’s last Skip’ (August
23, 1804). Bonaparte is represented in a harlequin’s suit,
enormous cocked hat, boots, and a blackened face. His
sword is broken, and, with upraised hands, in a supplicating
attitude, he exclaims, ‘O Sacre Dieu! John Bull is de
very Devil.’ John Bull, with upraised cudgel, says: ‘Mr.
Boney Party, you have changed Characters pretty often
and famously well, and skipped about at a precious rate.
But this Invasion hop is your last&mdash;we have got you snug&mdash;the
devil a trap to get through here&mdash;Your conjuration
sword has lost its Power; you have lied till you are black
in the face, and there is no believing a word you say&mdash;so
now you shall carry John Bull’s mark about with you, as
every swaggerer should.’</p>

<p>‘British men of war towing in the Invader’s Fleet,’
artist unknown (September 25, 1804), shows a number of
English sailors seated on the necks of French and Dutch
men, whom they are guiding over the sea to England.
One sailor, evidently a Scotchman, is pulling his opponent’s
ears; the poor Frenchman cries out, ‘Oh Morbleu! de
salt water make me sick; O mine pauvre Ears!’ but his
ruthless conqueror has no pity, ‘Deil tak your soul, ye
lubberly Loon, gin ye dinna mak aw sail, I’ll twist off your
lugs.’ An English sailor rides the redoubtable Boney, and
pulls his nose: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>‘Steady Master Emperor, if you regard
your Imperial Nose. Remember a British Tar has you in
tow&mdash;No more of this wonderful, this great and mighty
nation who frighten all the world with their buggabo
invasion.’ But Boney pleads, ‘Oh! mercy, take me back,
me will make you all Emperors; it will be Boney here,
Boney there, and Boney everywhere, and me wish to my
heart me was dead.’ An Irish sailor on a Dutchman yells
out, ‘By Jasus, my Jewel, these bum boats are quizzical
toys and sure&mdash;heave ahead, you bog trotting spalpeen,
or I shall be after keel hauling you. Huzza, Huzza, Huzza,
my boys, Huzza! ’Tis Britannia boys, Britannia rules the
waves.’ Another Dutchman complains, ‘O Mynheer Jan
English you vill break my back.’ But the relentless sailor
who bestrides him takes out his tobacco-box, and says,
‘Now for a quid of comfort! pretty gig for Jack Tars.
Good bye to your bombast, we’re going to Dover, Was
ever poor Boney, so fairly done over.’</p>

<p>A most remarkable caricature by Ansell (October 25,
1804) shows to what length party spirit will lead men&mdash;making
truth entirely subservient to party purposes. It
probably paid to vilify Napoleon, and consequently this
picture was produced. It is called ‘Boney’s Inquisition.
Another Specimen of his Humanity on the person of
Madame Toussaint.’ Whatever may be our opinion of
his treatment of Toussaint l’Ouverture, the only record
we have in history (and I have expended much time
and trouble in trying to find out the truth of the
matter) is that his family, who were brought to France
at the same time as himself, took up their residence
at Agen, where his wife died in 1816. His eldest son,
Isaac, died at Bordeaux in 1850. Now to describe the
picture. Madame l’Ouverture is depicted as being bound
to a stretcher nearly naked, whilst three Frenchmen are
tearing her breasts with red-hot pincers. Another is pulling
out her finger-nails with a similar instrument. She exclaims:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>‘Oh Justice! Oh Humanity, Oh Deceitfull Villain,
in vain you try to blot the Character of the English: ’tis
their magnanimity which harrasses your dastard soul.’ One
of the torturers says: ‘Eh! Diable! Why you no confess
noting?’ Napoleon is seated on his throne, watching the
scene with evident delight, chuckling to himself, ‘This is
Luxury. Jaffa, Acre, Toulon and D’Enghien was nothing
to it. Slave, those pincers are not half hot, save those
nails for my Cabinet, and if she dies, we can make a
confession for her.’</p>

<p>An unknown artist (December 11, 1804) gives us ‘The
death of Madame Republique.’ Madame lies a corpse on
her bed. Sieyès, as nurse, dandles the new emperor. John
Bull, spectacles on nose, inquires, ‘Pray Mr. Abbé Sayes&mdash;what
was the cause of the poor lady’s Death? She seem’d
at one time in a tolerable thriving way.’ Sieyès replies,
‘She died in Child bed, Mr. Bull, after giving birth to this

<span class="subhead">NAPOLEON’S CORONATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Napoleon’s coronation was the great event of the year;
but some time before it was consummated the English
caricaturist took advantage of it, and J.&nbsp;B. (West), in September
1804, produced a ‘Design for an Imperial Crown
to be used at the Coronation of the New Emperor.’ A
perusal of the foregoing pages will render any explanation
unnecessary.</p>

<div id="ip_23" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="600" height="501" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Cushion of Usurpation</div></div>

<p>Napoleon omitted no ceremony which could enhance
the pageant of his coronation. The Pope must be present:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
no meaner ecclesiastic should hallow this rite, and he was
gently <i>invited</i> to come to Paris for this purpose. Poor
Pius VII. had very little option in the matter. His master
wanted him, and he must needs go; but Napoleon gilded
the chain which drew him. During the whole of his
journey he was received with the greatest reverence, and
could hardly have failed to have been impressed with the
great care and attention paid to him. For instance, the
dangerous places in the passage of the Alps were protected
by parapets, so that his Holiness should incur no danger.
On his arrival at Paris he was lodged in the Tuileries, and
a very delicate attention was paid him&mdash;his bedchamber
was fitted as a counterpart of his own in the palace of
Monte-Cavallo, at Rome.</p>

<p>The eventful 2nd of December came at last; but, before
we note the ceremony itself, we must pause awhile to see
how the English caricaturist treated the procession.</p>

<p>Hardly any one of Gillray’s caricatures (January 1,
1805) is as effective as ‘The Grand Coronation Procession
of Napoleone the 1st, Emperor of France, from the Church
of Notre Dame, Dec. 2nd, 1804. Redeunt <span class="smcap">Satania</span> regna,
Iam nova progenies cœlo demittitur alto!’ Huge bodies
of troops form the background, whose different banners
are&mdash;a comet setting the world ablaze; an Imperial crown
and the letters SPQN; un Dieu, un Napoleon; a serpent
biting its tail, surrounding a crowned N. and a Sun,
‘Napoleone y<sup>e</sup> 1st le Soleil de la Constitution.’</p>

<p>The procession is headed by ‘His Imperial Highness
Prince Louis Buonaparte Marbœuf’ (a delicate hint as to
his paternity), ‘High Constable of the Empire,’ who, theatrically
dressed, struts, carrying a drum-major’s staff fashioned
like a sceptre. Behind him come <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>‘The Three Imperial
Graces, viz. their Imp. High. Princess Borghese, Princess
Louis (cher amie of y<sup>e</sup> Emperor) &amp; Princess Joseph Bonaparte.’
These ladies are clad in a most diaphanous costume,
which leaves little of their forms to the imagination,
and they occupy themselves by scattering flowers as they
pass along.</p>

<div id="ip_25" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="600" height="497" alt="" />
  <div class="captionl">THE THREE GRACES.</div>
  <div class="captionr">TALLEYRAND, KING AT ARMS.</div></div>

<p>After them comes ‘Madame Talleyrand (ci-devant
Mrs. Halhead the Prophetess),’ a stout, Jewish-looking
woman, who is ‘Conducting the Heir Apparent in y<sup>e</sup> Path
of Glory’&mdash;and a most precocious little imp it looks. After
them hobbles ‘Talleyrand Perigord, Prime Minister and
King at Arms, bearing the Emperor’s Genealogy,’ which
begins with ‘Buone Butcher,’ goes on with ‘Bonny Cuckold,’
till it reaches the apex of ‘Boney Emperor.’ Pope Pius
VII. follows, and under his cope is the devil disguised as
an acolyte, bearing a candle; Cardinal Fesch is by, and
acts as thurifer. The incense is in clouds: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>‘Les Addresses
des Municipalités de Paris&mdash;Les Adorations des Badauds&mdash;Les
Hommages des Canailles&mdash;Les Admirations des Fous&mdash;Les
Congratulations des Grenouilles&mdash;Les Humilités des
Poltrons.’</p>

  <img src="images/i_026.jpg" width="472" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">NAPOLEON IN HIS CORONATION ROBES.</div></div>

<p>Then comes the central figures of the pageant, ‘His
Imperial Majesty Napoleone y<sup>e</sup> 1<sup>st</sup> and the Empress
Josephine,’ the former scowling ferociously, the latter
looking blowsy, and fearfully stout. Three harridans, ‘ci-devant
Poissardes,’ support her train, whilst that of Napoleon
is borne by a Spanish don, an Austrian hussar, and a
Dutchman, whose tattered breeches testify to his poverty.
These are styled ‘Puissant Continental Powers&mdash;Train
Bearers to the Emperor.’ Following them come ‘Berthier,
Bernadotte, Angerou, and all the brave Train of Republican
Generals;’ but they are handcuffed, and their faces display,
unmistakably, the scorn in which they hold their old comrade.
Behind them poses a short corpulent figure, ‘Senator
Fouché, Intendant General of y<sup>e</sup> Police, bearing the Sword
of Justice.’ But Fouché is not content with this weapon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
His other hand grasps an assassin’s dagger, and both it,
and the sword, are well imbrued in blood. The rear of the
procession is made up of a ‘Garde d’Honneur,’ which consists
of a gaoler with the keys of the <i>Temple</i> and a set of
fetters; a <i>mouchard</i> with his report, ‘Espionnage de Paris;’
<i>Monsieur de Paris</i>, the executioner, bears a coil of rope
with a noose, and a banner with a representation of the
guillotine&mdash;and a prisoner, holding aloft two bottles respectively
labelled Arsenic and Opium. More banners and
more soldiers fill up the background.</p>

<p>What a sight that must have been on the morning of the
2nd of December! Visitors from all parts of France were
there; and the cathedral of Notre-Dame must have presented
a gorgeous <i>coup d’œil</i>, with its splendid ecclesiastical vestments,
its magnificent uniforms, and the beautiful dresses
and jewels of the ladies. It can hardly be imagined, so
had better be described in the words of an eyewitness,
Madame Junot.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>‘Who that saw Notre-Dame on that memorable day,
can ever forget it? I have witnessed in that venerable
pile the celebration of sumptuous and solemn festivals;
but never did I see anything at all approximating in splendour
to the <i>coup d’œil</i> exhibited at Napoleon’s Coronation.
The vaulted roof re-echoed the sacred chanting of the
priests, who invoked the blessing of the Almighty on the
ceremony about to be celebrated, while they awaited the
arrival of the Vicar of Christ, whose throne was prepared
near the altar. Along the ancient walls of tapestry were
ranged, according to their rank, the different bodies of the
State, the deputies from every City; in short, the representatives
of all France assembled to implore the benediction
of Heaven on the sovereign of the people’s choice.
The waving plumes which adorned the hats of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Senators, Counsellors of State, and Tribunes; the splendid
uniforms of the military; the clergy in all their ecclesiastical
pomp; and the multitude of young and beautiful
women, glittering in jewels, and arrayed in that style of
grace and elegance which is only seen in Paris;&mdash;altogether
presented a picture which has, perhaps, rarely been equalled,
and certainly never excelled.</p>

<p>‘The Pope arrived first; and at the moment of his
entering the Cathedral, the anthem <i>Tu es Petrus</i> was commenced.
His Holiness advanced from the door with an
air at once majestic and humble. Ere long, the firing of
cannon announced the departure of the procession from
the Tuileries. From an early hour in the morning the
weather had been exceedingly unfavourable. It was cold
and rainy, and appearances seemed to indicate that the
procession would be anything but agreeable to those who
joined it. But, as if by the especial favour of Providence,
of which so many instances are observable in the career of
Napoleon, the clouds suddenly dispersed, the sky brightened
up, and the multitudes who lined the streets from the
Tuileries to the Cathedral, enjoyed the sight of the procession,
without being, as they had anticipated, drenched by a
December rain. Napoleon, as he passed along, was greeted
by heartfelt expressions of enthusiastic love and attachment.</p>

<p>‘On his arrival at Notre-Dame, Napoleon ascended the
throne, which was erected in front of the grand altar.
Josephine took her place beside him, surrounded by the
assembled sovereigns of Europe. Napoleon appeared singularly
calm. I watched him narrowly, with the view of
discovering whether his heart beat more highly beneath
the imperial trappings, than under the uniform of the
guards; but I could observe no difference, and yet I was
at the distance of only ten paces from him. The length of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the ceremony, however, seemed to weary him; and I saw
him several times check a yawn. Nevertheless, he did
everything he was required to do, and did it with propriety.
When the Pope anointed him with the triple
unction on his head and both hands, I fancied, from the
direction of his eyes, that he was thinking of wiping off
the oil rather than of anything else; and I was so perfectly
acquainted with the workings of his countenance, that I
have no hesitation in saying that was really the thought
that crossed his mind at that moment. During the ceremony
of anointing, the Holy Father delivered that impressive
prayer which concluded with these words:&mdash;“Diffuse,
O Lord, by my hands, the treasures of your grace and
benediction on your servant, Napoleon, whom, in spite of
our personal unworthiness, <i>we this day anoint Emperor, in
your name</i>.” Napoleon listened to this prayer with an air
of pious devotion; but just as the Pope was about to take
the crown, called the <i>Crown of Charlemagne</i>, from the
altar, Napoleon seized it, and placed it on his own head.
At that moment he was really handsome, and his countenance
was lighted up with an expression, of which no words
can convey an idea. He had removed the wreath of laurel
which he wore on entering the church, and which encircles
his brow in the fine picture of Gérard. The crown was,
perhaps, in itself, less becoming to him; but the expression
excited by the act of putting it on, rendered him perfectly
handsome.</p>

<p>‘When the moment arrived for Josephine to take an
active part in the grand drama, she descended from the
throne and advanced towards the altar, where the Emperor
awaited her, followed by her retinue of Court ladies, and
having her train borne by the Princesses Caroline, Julie,
Eliza, and Louis. One of the chief beauties of the Empress
Josephine was not merely her fine figure, but the elegant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
turn of her neck, and the way in which she carried her
head; indeed, her deportment, altogether, was conspicuous
for dignity and grace. I have had the honour of being
presented to many <i>real princesses</i>, to use the phrase of the
Faubourg St.-Germain, but I never saw one who, to my
eyes, presented so perfect a personification of elegance and
majesty. In Napoleon’s countenance, I could read the
conviction of all I have just said. He looked with an air
of complacency at the Empress as she advanced towards
him; and when she knelt down&mdash;when the tears, which
she could not repress, fell upon her clasped hands, as they
were raised to Heaven, or rather to Napoleon&mdash;both then
appeared to enjoy one of those fleeting moments of pure
felicity, which are unique in a lifetime, and serve to fill up
a lustrum of years. The Emperor performed, with peculiar
grace, every action required of him during the ceremony;
but his manner of crowning Josephine was most remarkable:
after receiving the small crown, surmounted by the
Cross, he had first to place it on his own head, and then
to transfer it to that of the Empress. When the moment
arrived for placing the crown on the head of the woman,
whom popular superstition regarded as his good genius,
his manner was almost playful. He took great pains to
arrange this little crown, which was placed over Josephine’s
tiara of diamonds; he put it on, then took it off, and finally
put it on again, as if to promise her she should wear it
gracefully and lightly.’</p>

<p>It is almost painful, after reading this vivid and soul-stirring
description, to have to descend to the level of
the caricaturist descanting on the same subject; it is
a kind of moral douche bath, giving all one’s nerves a
shock.</p>

<p>Authentic news of the coronation did not reach England
for nearly a fortnight, and it was not till December 15 that
the ‘Times’ was able to give its readers a full account of
the ceremony. ‘The Thunderer’ waxed very wroth about
it, as may be seen by the following extract from its leader
of that <span class="locked">date:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘The “Moniteur” merely insinuates that the sun miraculously
penetrated through a thick fog, to be present
at it: a compliment which is a little diminished by a
subsequent assertion, that the lamps were afterwards able
to supply his place by giving a noon-day brilliancy to the
night. Then follows a disgusting hypocritical panegyric
upon the union of civil and religious acts and ceremonies,
the sublime representation of all that human and divine
affairs could assemble to strike the mind&mdash;the venerable
Apostolic virtues of the poor Pope, and the most astonishing
genius of Buonaparte crowned by the most astonishing
destiny!</p>

<p>‘The public will find these details, under their proper
head, in this paper. To us, we confess, all that appears
worthy of remark or memory in that opprobrious day is,
that amongst all the Royalists and Republicans of France,
it was able to produce neither a <span class="smcap">Brutus</span> nor a <span class="smcap">Chœreas</span>!</p>

<p>‘The day subsequent to the coronation, the people of
Paris were entertained upon the bridges, boulevards, and
public places, with popular sports, dancing, and other pastimes
and diversions.</p>

<p>‘Upon the <span class="smcap">Place de Concorde</span>, still stained with the blood
of the lawful sovereign of France, were erected saloons and
pavilions for dancing <i>waltzes</i>. Medals were given away
to the populace; illuminations, artificial fireworks, pantomimes,
and buffoons, musicians, temporary theatres, everything
was represented and administered that could intoxicate
and divert this vain and wicked people from contemplating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
the crime they were committing. To the profanation of
the preceding day, it seems that all the orgies of wantonness
and corruption succeeded in the most curious and
careful rotation, and that all the skill and science of the
<span class="smcap">Davids</span> and <span class="smcap">Cheniers</span> has been exhausted to keep them
for four and twenty hours from thinking upon what they
had done.’</p>

<p>But not only in leaders did the ‘Times’ pour forth its
wrath; it published little jokelets occasionally, which were
meant to be very stinging, as, for instance: Monsieur
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> has distributed his Eagles by thousands. What
his <i>talents</i> might be doubtful of accomplishing, he expects
from his <i>talons</i>.’</p>

<p>The ‘Daily Advertiser’, too, of December 15 contains
some pretty sentiments on the coronation, such as, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>‘If
Modern Europe will, after such fair notice, and a notice so
often repeated, by the French Government, still remain in
sluggish inaction, in stupid astonishment, at the success of
that Ruffian, who now wields the sceptre of <span class="smcap">Charlemagne</span>,
and has dragooned the <span class="smcap">Pope</span> to his Coronation, it is evident
that nations so besotted are only fit to be enslaved.’</p>

<p>NAPOLEON’S LETTER TO GEORGE THE THIRD&mdash;NAVAL VICTORIES&mdash;CROWNED
KING OF ITALY&mdash;ALLIANCE OF EUROPE&mdash;WITHDRAWAL OF
THE ‘ARMY OF ENGLAND.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Very shortly after his coronation, and with the commencement
of the year 1805, Napoleon wrote a letter to George
the Third, intimating how beneficial peace would be to
both countries.</p>

<p>The text of this letter, and its answer, are as <span class="locked">follow:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sire, my brother,&mdash;Called to the throne by Providence, and the
suffrages of the Senate, the people, and the army, my first feeling
was the desire for peace. France and England abuse their prosperity:
they may continue their strife for ages; but will their
governments, in so doing, fulfil the most sacred of the duties
which they owe to their people? And how will they answer to
their consciences for so much blood uselessly shed, and without
the prospect of any good whatever to their subjects? I am not
ashamed to make the first advances. I have, I flatter myself,
sufficiently proved to the world that I fear none of the chances of
war. It presents nothing which I have occasion to fear. Peace
is the wish of my heart; but war has never been adverse to my
glory. I conjure your Majesty, therefore, not to refuse yourself
the satisfaction of giving peace to the world. Never was an occasion
more favourable for calming the passions, and giving ear only
to the sentiments of humanity and reason. If that opportunity be
lost, what limit can be assigned to a war which all my efforts have
been unable to terminate? Your Majesty has gained more during
the last ten years than the whole extent of Europe in riches and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
territory: your subjects are in the very highest state of prosperity:
what can you expect from a war? To form a Coalition of the
Continental powers? Be assured the Coalition will remain at
peace. A coalition will only increase the strength and preponderance
of the French Empire. To renew our intestine divisions?
The times are no longer the same. To destroy our finances?
Finances founded on a flourishing agriculture can never be destroyed.
To wrest from France her Colonies? They are to her
only a secondary consideration; and your Majesty has already
enough and to spare of these possessions. Upon reflection, you
must, I am persuaded, yourself arrive at the conclusion, that the
war is maintained without an object; and what a melancholy prospect,
for two great nations to combat merely for the sake of fighting!
The world is surely large enough for both to live in; and reason
has still sufficient power to find the means of reconciliation, if the
inclination only is not wanting. I have now, at least, discharged
a duty dear to my heart. May your Majesty trust to the sincerity
of the sentiments which I have now expressed, and the reality of
my desire to give the most convincing proofs of it.</p></blockquote>

<p>George the Third could not, constitutionally, personally
reply to this letter, so Lord Mulgrave answered it, under date
of January 14, and addressed it to Talleyrand. It ran thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>His Britannic Majesty has received the letter addressed to
him by the Chief of the French Government There is nothing
which his Majesty has more at heart, than to seize the first opportunity
of restoring to his subjects the blessings of peace, provided
it is founded upon a basis not incompatible with the permanent
interests, and security, of his dominions. His Majesty is persuaded
that that object cannot be attained but by arrangements, which
may at the same time provide for the future peace, and security,
of Europe, and prevent a renewal of the dangers, and misfortunes,
by which it is now overwhelmed. In conformity with these sentiments,
his Majesty feels that he cannot give a more specific
answer to the overture which he has received until he has had
time to communicate with the Continental powers to whom he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
is united in the most confidential manner, and particularly the
Emperor of Russia, who has given the strongest proofs of the
wisdom, and elevation, of the sentiments by which he is animated,
and of the lively interest which he takes in the security and independence
of Europe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Apropos of this pacific overture, there is a very badly
drawn picture by Woodward (February 1, 1805), ‘A New
Phantasmagoria for John Bull.’ Napoleon is seated on
the French coast, directing his magic lantern towards John
Bull, exclaiming, ‘Begar de brave Galanté shew for Jonny
Bull.’ The magic lantern slide shows Napoleon coming
over on a visit, with a tricoloured flag in one hand, the
other leading the Empress Josephine, whose dress is <i>semée</i>
with bees. ‘Here we come Johnny&mdash;A flag of Truce
Johnny&mdash;something like a Piece! all decked out in Bees,
and stars, and a crown on her head; not such a patched
up piece as the last.’ The Russian bear is on one rock,
John Bull on another&mdash;the latter having his sword drawn.
He says: ‘You may be d&mdash;d, and your piece too! I suppose
you thought I was off the watch&mdash;I tell you, I’ll say
nothing to you till I have consulted Brother Bruin, and I
hear him growling terribly in the offing.’</p>

<p>So we see that there was no hope of peace, as yet, and
the war goes on. I can hardly localise the following <span class="locked">caricature:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Argus (January 24, 1805) drew ‘The glorious Pursuit
of Ten against Seventeen.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">God like his Courage seem’d, whom nor Delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could soften, nor the Face of Death affright.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The French and Spaniards are in full flight, calling out,
‘By Gar dare be dat tam Nelson dat Salamander dat do
love to live in de fire, by Gar we make haste out of his
way, or he blow us all up.’ Nelson leads on nine old sea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
dogs, encouraging them thus: ‘The Enemy are flying
before you my brave fellows, <i>Seventeen</i> against <i>Ten</i> of us.
Crowd all the Sail you can, and then for George, Old
England&mdash;<i>Death</i> or <i>Victory</i>!!!’ His followers utter such
sentences as the following: ‘My Noble Commander, we’ll
follow you the world over, and shiver my Timbers but we
shall soon bring up our lee way, and then, as sure as my
name is Tom Grog, we’ll give them another touch of the
Battle of the Nile’&mdash;‘May I never hope to see Poll again, if
I would not give a whole month’s flip if these lubberly
Parly vous would but just stop one half watch,’ &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The style in which our sailors worked is very aptly
illustrated in a letter from an officer on board the <i>Fisgard</i>,
off Cape St. Vincent, dated November 28, 1804.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> We
must remember that war was not officially declared against
Spain until January 11, 1805; but this gentleman writes:
‘We cannot desire a better station; we heard of hostilities
with Spain on October the 15th, and on that very day we
captured two Ships. Lord Nelson received from us the
first intelligence&mdash;we have already taken twelve ships and
entertain hopes of as many more. Yesterday we fell in
with the <i>Donegal</i>, Capt. Sir R. Strachan, who has taken a
large Spanish Frigate, the <i>Amphitrite</i>, after a chase of 46
hours, and 15 minutes’ action, in which the Spanish Captain
was killed; the prize was from Cadiz, with despatches
for <i>Teneriffe</i> and the <i>Havana</i>, laden with stores. The
<i>Amphitrite</i> Frigate, of 42 Guns, was one of the finest
Frigates in the Spanish Navy. The <i>Donegal</i> chased the
<i>Amphitrite</i> for several hours, sometimes gaining upon her,
and sometimes losing; at length the <i>Amphitrite</i> carried
away her mizen top mast, which enabled the <i>Donegal</i> to
come up with her. A Boat was then despatched by Sir
Richard for the purpose of bringing the Spanish Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
on board. Some difficulty arose from neither party understanding
the language of the other; at length Sir Richard
acquainted the Spanish Captain, that in compliance with
the Orders he had received from his Admiral, he was under
the necessity of conducting the <i>Amphitrite</i> back again to
Cadiz, and he allowed the Spanish Captain three minutes
to determine whether he would comply without compelling
him to have recourse to force. After waiting six minutes
in vain for a favourable answer, the <i>Donegal</i> fired into the
<i>Amphitrite</i>, which was immediately answered with a broadside.
An engagement then ensued, which lasted about
eight minutes, when the <i>Amphitrite</i> struck her colours.
During this short engagement the Spanish Captain was
unfortunately killed by a musket ball. The <i>Donegal</i> has
also captured another Spanish ship, supposed the richest
that ever sailed from Cadiz, her cargo reported worth
200,000<i>l.</i>’</p>

<p>Another letter, dated November 29, adds, ‘We have
this day taken a large Ship from the River de la Plata.’</p>

<p>They had captured the following ships previous to
December 3:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is now almost a total cessation of caricature until
the autumn; and it probably was in this wise. Napoleon
did not actively bother this country; his thoughts were,
for the time, elsewhere. On March 17 a deputation from
the Italian Republic waited upon him, stating that it was
the desire of their countrymen that he should be their
monarch, and accordingly on April 2 he and Josephine left
Paris for Milan.</p>

<p>An amateur drew, and Gillray etched (August 2,
1805), ‘St. George and the Dragon, a Design for an
Equestrian Statue from the Original in Windsor Castle.’
Napoleon (a most ferocious dragon) has seized upon poor
Britannia, who, dropping her spear and shield, her hair
dishevelled, and her dress disordered, with upraised arm,
attempts to avert her fate; but St. George (George the
Third) on horseback, comes to the rescue, and, smiting that
dragon, cleaves his crown.</p>

<p>As a practical illustration of the servile adulation with
which he was treated, take the following etching by Woodward
(September 15, 1805): ‘Napoleon’s Apotheosis Anticipated,
or the Wise Men of Leipsic sending Boney to
Heaven before his time!!! At the German University of
Leipsic, it was decreed that the Constellation called Orion’s
Belt should hereafter be named Napoleon in Honor of that
Hero.&mdash;Query&mdash;Did the Wise men of Leipsic mean it as
an honor, or a reflection on the turbulent spirit of Boney,
as the rising of Orion is generally accompanied with
Storms and Tempests, for which reason he has the Sword
in his hand.’ Orion has his belt round Napoleon’s neck,
and is hoisting him up to heaven thereby; Napoleon is
kicking and struggling, and exclaims, ‘What are you about&mdash;I
tell you I would rather stay where I was.’ The German
<i>savants</i> are watching him through their telescopes, saying,
‘He mounts finely’&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>‘I think we have now made ourselves
immortal’&mdash;‘It was a sublime idea’&mdash;‘Orion seems to receive
him better than I expected.’ This is confirmed in ‘Scot’s
Magazine,’ 1807<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>: ‘The University of Leipzig has resolved
henceforth to call by the name of Napoleon that group of
stars which lies between the girdle and the sword of Orion;
and a numerous deputation of the University was appointed
to present the “Conqueror” with a map of the group so
named!’</p>

<p>Napoleon hardly reckoned on Austria taking up arms
against him without a formal declaration of war, and was
rather put to it to find men to oppose the Allies, whose
forces were reckoned at 250,000 men; whilst France,
though with 275,000 men at her disposal, had 180,000 of
them locked up in the so-called ‘Army of England.’ We
can imagine his chagrin in having to forego his cherished
plan of invasion, and being compelled to withdraw his
troops from the French shores.</p>

<p>The ‘Times’ (how different a paper it was in those
days to what it is now!) is jubilant thereupon.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> ‘The
<i>Scene</i> that now opens upon the soldiers of France, by
being obliged to leave the coast and march eastwards, is
sadly different from that <i>Land of Promise</i>, which, for two
years, has been held out to them, in all sorts of gay delusions.
After all the efforts of the <i>Imperial Boat-Builder</i>,
instead of sailing over the <i>Channel</i>, they will have to cross
the <i>Rhine</i>. The bleak <i>forests</i> of Suabia will make but a
sorry exchange for the promised spoils of our <i>Docks</i> and
<i>Warehouses</i>. They will not find any equivalent for the
<i>plunder</i> of the <i>Bank</i> in another bloody passage through
“<i>the Valley of Hell</i>”; but they seem to have forgotten the
magnificent promise of the <i>Milliard</i>.’</p>

<p>The French papers affected to make light of this
death-blow to their hopes; one of them, quoted in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
‘Times’ of September 13, says: ‘Whilst the German
Papers, with much noise, make more troops march than all
the Powers together possess, France, which needs not to
augment her forces in order to display them in an imposing
manner, detaches a few thousand troops from the
Army of England to cover her frontiers, which are menaced
by the imprudent conduct of Austria.’</p>

<p>The caricaturist, of course, made capital out of it, and
Rowlandson (October 1, 1805) designed ‘The departure
from the Coast or the End of the Farce of Invasion.’
Napoleon, seated on a sorry ass, is sadly returning, inland,
homeward, to the intense delight of some French monkeys.
His Iron Crown is tottering off his head, and his steed is
loaded with the Boulogne Encampment, the Army of
England, and Excuses for non-performance. The British
Lion on the English cliffs lifts his leg and gives Boney
a parting salute. The latter exclaims, ‘Bless me, what a
shower! I shall be wet through before I reach the Rhine.’</p>

<p>The action of the Allies is shown by the caricature,
‘Tom Thumb at Bay, or the Sovereigns of the Forest
roused at last,’ by Ansell (October 1805), which shows the
Lilliputian Emperor, who has thrown away his crown and
sceptre, being fiercely pursued by a double-headed eagle,
a bear, and a boar, and is rushing into the open jaws of
a ferocious lion. ‘Which way shall I escape? If I fly
from the Bear and the Eagle, I fall into the jaws of the
Lion!!’ Holland, Spain, and Italy, all have yokes round
their necks&mdash;but, seeing Bonaparte’s condition, Holland
takes his off and lays it on the ground. The Spaniard,
surprised, exclaims, ‘Why! Mynheer, you have got your
yoke off!’ And the Italian, who is preparing to remove
his, says, ‘I think Mynheer’s right, and now’s the time,
Don, to get ours off.’ An army of rats is labelled, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>‘Co-Estates

<span class="subhead">SURRENDER OF ULM&mdash;BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR&mdash;PROPOSALS FOR PEACE&mdash;DANIEL
LAMBERT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Meantime the Austrians were in a very awkward position.
General Mack was, from October 13, closely invested in
Ulm, and Napoleon had almost need to restrain his troops,
who were flushed with victory and eager for the assault.
The carnage on both sides would, in such a case, have been
awful; but Napoleon clearly pointed out to Mack his
position: how that, in eight days, he would be forced to
capitulate for want of food: that the Russians were yet far
off, having scarcely reached Bohemia; that no other aid
was nigh:&mdash;and on October 20, the gates of Ulm were
opened, and 36,000 Austrian troops slowly defiled therefrom.
Sixteen generals surrendered with Mack, and Napoleon
treated them generously. All the officers were allowed
to go home, their parole, not to fight against France until
there had been a general exchange of prisoners, only being
required; and Napoleon sent 50,000 prisoners into France,
distributing them throughout the agricultural districts.</p>

<p>Gillray drew (November 6, 1805) ‘The Surrender of
Ulm, or Buonaparte and Gen<sup>l</sup> Mack coming to a right
understanding&mdash;Intended as a Specimen of French Victories&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
Conquering without Bloodshed!!!’ It shows a little
Napoleon, seated on a drum, whilst Mack and some other
generals are grovelling on all fours, delivering up their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
swords, banners, and the keys of Ulm, to the conqueror.
Napoleon, pointing to three large sacks of money, borne
by as many soldiers, exclaims: ‘There’s your Price!
There’s Ten Millions&mdash;Twenty!! It is not in my Army
alone that my resources of Conquering consists!! I hate
victory obtain’d by effusion of blood.’ ‘And so do I,’ says
the crawling Mack; ‘What signifies Fighting when we can
settle it in a safer way.’ On the ground is a scroll of
‘Articles to be deliver’d up. 1 Field Marshal. 8 Generals
in Chief. 7 Lieutenant Generals. 36 Thousand Soldiers. 80
pieces of Cannon. 50 Stand of Colours. 100,000 Pounds of
Powder. 4,000 Cannon Balls.’</p>

<p>This subject also attracted the pencil of I. Cruikshank
(November 19, 1805): ‘Boney beating Mack&mdash;and Nelson
giving him a Whack!! or the British Tars giving Boney
his Hearts desire, <span class="smcap">Ships</span>, <span class="smcap">Colonies</span> and <span class="smcap">Commerce</span>.’ Mack
is kneeling in a suppliant manner before Bonaparte, who
stamps upon his captive’s sword, addressing him: ‘I want
not your Forts, your Cities, nor your territories! Sir, I only
want Ships, Colonies and Commerce’&mdash;a very slight variation
from the real text of his address to the vanquished
Austrian officers: ‘I desire nothing further upon the Continent.
I want ships, colonies, and commerce; and it is
as much your interest, as mine, that I should have them.’
During this peroration military messengers are arriving.
One calls out, ‘May it please your King’s Majesty’s Emperor.
That Dam Nelson take all your ships. Twenty at
a time. Begar, if you no come back directly they vill not
leave you vone boat to go over in.’ Another runs along
crying, ‘Run, ma foi, anoder Dam Nelson take ever so
many more ships.’ This is an allusion to the battle of
Trafalgar (October 21, 1805),<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> where Nelson paid for his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
victory with his life. This is further illustrated in another
portion of the engraving, by Nelson, who is towing the
captured vessels, kneeling at Britannia’s feet, saying: ‘At
thy feet, O Goddess of the seas, I resign my life in the
service of my country.’ Britannia replies: ‘My Son, thy
Name shall be recorded in the page of History on tablets
of the brightest Gold.’</p>

<p>Rowlandson (November 13, 1805) further alludes to
the surrender of Ulm and the battle of Trafalgar: ‘Nap
Buonaparte in a fever on receiving the Extraordinary
Gazette of Nelson’s Victory over the combined Fleets.’
Boney is very sick and miserable, the combined effects of
the news which he has read in the paper which falls from
his trembling hands&mdash;the ‘Extraordinary Gazette. 19 Sail
of the line taken by Lord Nelson.’ He appeals to four
doctors, who are in consultation on his case: ‘My dear
Doctors! those Sacré Anglois have play’d the Devil vid
my Constitution. Pray tell me what is the matter with
me. I felt the first symptoms when I told Gen<sup>l</sup> Mack I
wanted Ships, Colonies and Commerce. Oh dear! oh
dear! I shall want more ships now&mdash;this is a cursed sensation&mdash;Oh
I am very qualmish.’ One doctor opines it is
‘a desperate case,’ another that he is ‘Irrecoverable.’ One
recommends bleeding; but one has thoroughly investigated
the case, and found out the cause: ‘Begar, me have found
it out, <i>your heart be in your breeches</i>!’</p>

There were no caricatures of the battle of Trafalgar&mdash;the
victory was purchased at too great a cost; but Gillray
executed a serious etching in memory of Nelson, published
on December 29, 1805, the funeral of the hero taking place
on the subsequent 9th of January.</p>

<p>The following caricature shows the quality of news
supplied to our <span class="locked">forefathers:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘John Bull exchanging News with the Continent’ is by
Woodward, December 11, 1805, and represents Napoleon
and a French newsboy on a rock called <i>Falsehood</i>, disseminating
news the reverse of true. The ‘Journal de
l’Empire’ says that Archduke Charles is dead with
fatigue; the ‘Journal de Spectacle’ that England is invaded.
The ‘Gazette de France’ informs us that the
English fleet is dispersed, and the ‘Publicité’ follows it
with the news that the combined fleets are sent in pursuit.
False bulletins are being scattered broadcast. These, however,
have but little effect on John Bull, who, attired as a
newsboy, stands on the rock of Truth, flourishing a paper,
‘Trafalgar London Gazette extraordinary,’ and bellowing
through his horn, ‘Total defeat of the Combin’d Fleets of
France and Spain,’ which is vividly depicted in the background.</p>

<p>‘Tiddy doll, the great French Gingerbread Baker,
drawing out a new Batch of Kings&mdash;his man Hopping
Talley mixing up the Dough,’ is a somewhat elaborate
etching by Gillray (January 23, 1806). The celebrated
gingerbread maker has, on a ‘peel,’ three kings, duly gilt&mdash;Bavaria,
Wurtemberg, and Baden&mdash;which he is just introducing
into the ‘New French Oven for Imperial Gingerbread.’
On a chest of three drawers, relatively labelled
Kings and Queens, Crowns and Sceptres, and Suns and
Moons, are a quantity of ‘Little Dough Viceroys, intended
for the next batch.’ Under the oven is an <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>‘Ash hole for
broken Gingerbread,’ and a broom&mdash;‘the Corsican Besom
of Destruction’&mdash;has swept therein La République Française,
Italy, Austria, Spain, Netherlands, Switzerland,
Holland, and Venice. On the ground is a fool’s cap and
bells, which acts as a cornucopia (labelled ‘Hot Spiced
Gingerbread, all hot; Come, who dips in my lucky bag’),
which disgorges stars and orders, principalities, dukedoms,
crowns, sceptres, cardinals’ hats, and bishops’ mitres; and a
baker’s basket is full of ‘True Corsican Kinglings for Home
Consumption and Exportation.’</p>

  <div class="caption">TIDDY DOLL, THE GREAT FRENCH GINGERBREAD BAKER, DRAWING
OUT A NEW BATCH OF KINGS.</div></div>

<p>Talleyrand&mdash;with a mitre on his head, and beads and
cross round his waist, to show his ecclesiastical status;
with a pen in his mouth, and ink-pot slung to his side, to
denote his diplomatic functions&mdash;is hard at work at the
‘Political Kneading Trough,’ mixing up Hungary, Poland,
Turkey, &amp;c., whilst an eagle (Prussia) is pecking at a piece
of dough (Hanover).</p>

<p>To thoroughly understand this caricature, we must first
of all know something about <i>Tiddy Doll</i>. He was a seller<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
of gingerbread, and was as famous in his time as was <i>Colly
Molly Puff</i> in the time of Steele and Addison. He had a
refrain, all his own, like a man well known to dwellers in
Brighton and the West End of London&mdash;‘<i>Brandy balls</i>.’
Hone<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> gives the best account of him that I know. Discoursing
on <i>May fair</i>, he says: ‘Here, too, was <i>Tiddy-doll</i>;
this celebrated vendor of gingerbread, from his eccentricity
of character and extensive dealings in his way, was always
hailed as the king of itinerant tradesmen.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> In his person
he was tall, well made, and his features handsome. He
affected to dress like a person of rank: white, gold-laced,
suit of clothes, laced ruffled shirt, laced hat and feather,
white silk stockings, with the addition of a fine white apron.
Among his harangues to gain customers, take this as a
specimen: “Mary, Mary, where are you <i>now</i>, Mary? I
live, when at home, at the second house in little Ball Street,
two steps under ground, with a wiscum, riscum, and a why
not. Walk in ladies and gentlemen; my shop is on the
second floor backwards, with a brass knocker at the door.
Here is your nice gingerbread, your spice gingerbread; it
will melt in your mouth like a redhot brickbat, and rumble
in your inside like Punch and his wheelbarrow.” He always
finished his address by singing this fag end of some popular
ballad.</p>

<p>Pitt died on January 23, 1806, and Fox succeeded him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
It is probable that Napoleon reckoned somewhat on Fox’s
friendship, and hence the following <span class="locked">caricature:&mdash;</span></p>

<div id="ip_51" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="600" height="528" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">BONEY AND THE GREAT STATE SECRETARY.</div></div>

<p>‘Boney and the Great Secretary’ (Argus, February
1806) gives a good portrait of Fox. Napoleon wishes to
be friendly: ‘How do you do, Master Charley, why you
are so fine, I scarcely knew ye&mdash;don’t you remember me,
why I am little Boney the Corsican&mdash;him that you came to
see at Paris, and very civil I was to you, I’m sure. If you
come my way I shall be glad to see you, so will my wife
and family. They are a little changed in their dress, as
well as you. We shall be very happy to take a little <i>peace</i>
soup with you, whenever you are inclined, Master Charley.’
But Fox shakes his fist at him: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>‘Why, you little Corsican
Reptile! how dare you come so near the person of the
Right Honble C&mdash;&mdash; J&mdash;&mdash; F&mdash;&mdash; one of his M&mdash;&mdash; principal
Secretaries of State, Member of the P.C. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.,
&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.&mdash;go to see <span class="smcap">You</span>!!! Arrogant little
Man, Mr. Boney&mdash;if you do not instantly vanish from my
sight&mdash;I’le break every bone in your body&mdash;learn to behave
yourself in a <i>peaceable</i> manner, nor dare to set your foot on
this happy land without <span class="smcap">My</span> leave.’</p>

<p>Of ‘Pacific Overtures, or a Flight from St. Cloud, “over
the Water to Charley,” a new Dramatic Peace now rehearsing’
(Gillray, April 5, 1806), only a portion is given in
the accompanying illustration, but quite sufficient to explain
the negotiations for peace then in progress.</p>

<div id="ip_52" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="600" height="467" alt="" /></div>

<p>This caricature is far too elaborate to reproduce the
whole, and the allusions therein are extremely intricate and,
nowadays, uninteresting. A theatrical stage is represented,
with Napoleon descending in clouds, pointing to Terms of
Peace, which are being displayed by Talleyrand, and saying,
‘There’s my terms.’ These are as follow: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>‘Acknowledge
me as Emperor; dismantle your fleet; reduce your army;
abandon Malta and Gibraltar; renounce all Continental
connexion; your Colonies I will take at a valuation; engage
to pay to the Great Nation, for seven years annually,
£1,000,000; and place in my hands as hostages, the Princess
Charlotte of Wales, with ten of the late administration,
whom I shall name.’</p>

<p>King George has stepped from his box on to the stage,
and is surveying this vision through his glass, exclaiming:
‘Very amusing terms indeed, and might do vastly well
with some of the new made little gingerbread kings<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>; but
we are not in the habit of giving up either “ships, or commerce,
or colonies” merely because little Boney is in a pet
to have them!!!’</p>

<p>Ansell (April 1806) drew ‘Roast Beef and French
Soup. The English Lamb * * * and the French Tiger,’
and it seems merely designed for the purpose of introducing
Daniel Lambert, who was then on exhibition&mdash;‘Daniel
Lambert who at the age of 36 weighed above 50 Stone,
14 Pounds to the Stone, measured 3 yards 4 inches round
the Body, and 1 yard 1 inch round the leg. 5 feet 11 inches
high.’ It shows the redoubtable fat man seated on a
couch, carving a round of beef, which is accompanied by a
large mustard-pot, a huge loaf, and a foaming pot of stout.
Napoleon, seated on a similar couch, on the opposite side
of the table, is taking soup&mdash;then an unaccustomed article
of food with Englishmen&mdash;and looks with horror at the
other’s size and manner of feeding.</p>

<p>Daniel Lambert was like Mr. Dick in ‘David Copperfield,’
who would persist in putting King Charles the First’s
head into his Memorial; he could hardly be kept out of
the caricatures. Ansell produced one (May 1806)&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>‘Two
Wonders of the World, or a Specimen of a new troop of
Leicestershire Light Horse.&mdash;Mr. Daniel Lambert, who at
the age of 36 weighed above 50 Stone, 14 Pounds to the
Stone, measured 3 yards 4 inches round the body and 1
yard 1 inch round the leg, 5 feet 11 inches high. The
famous horse Monarch, the largest in the World is upwards
of 21 hands high, (above 7 foot)<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and only 6 Years old.’
Lambert is mounted on this extraordinary quadruped, and,
sword in hand, is riding at poor little Boney, who exclaims
in horror, ‘Parbleu! if dis be de specimen of de English
light Horse, vat vill de Heavy Horse be? Oh, by Gar, I
vill put off de Invasion for anoder time.’</p>

<p>Yet once more are these two brought into juxtaposition,
in an engraving by Knight (April 15, 1806), ‘Bone and
Flesh, or John Bull in moderate Condition.’ Napoleon is
looking at this prodigy, and saying, ‘I contemplate this
Wonder of the World, and regret that all my Conquered
Domains cannot match this Man. Pray, Sir, are you not
a descendant from the great Joss of China?’ Lambert
replies, ‘No Sir, I am a true born Englishman, from the
County of Leicester. A quiet mind, and good Constitution,
nourished by the free Air of Great Britain, makes every
Englishman thrive.’</p>

<p>Another of Gillray’s caricatures into which Napoleon is
introduced, but in which he plays a secondary part, is
called ‘Comforts of a Bed of Roses; vide Charley’s elucidation
of Lord C&mdash;stl&mdash;r&mdash;gh’s speech! Nightly Scene
near Cleveland row.’ This is founded on a speech of Lord
Castlereagh’s, in which he congratulated the Ministry as
having ‘a bed of roses.’ But Fox, in reply, recounted his
difficulties and miseries, and said: ‘Really, it is insulting
to tell me I am on a bed of roses, when I feel myself torn,
and stung, by brambles, and nettles, whichever way I turn.’</p>

<p>Fox and Mrs. Fox are shown as sleeping on a bed of
roses, some of which peep out from underneath the rose-coloured
counterpane, but which display far more of thorns
than of roses. There is the <i>India rose</i>, the Emancipation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
rose, the French rose, the Coalition rose, and the Volunteer
rose. Fox’s slumbers are terribly disturbed; his <i>bonnet
rouge</i>, which he wears as night-cap, has tumbled off; his
night-shirt is seized at the neck, on one side by the ghost
of Pitt, who exclaims: ‘Awake, arise, or be for ever
fall’n!’ The other side is fiercely clutched by Napoleon,
who, drawn sword in hand, has just stepped on to the
bed from a cannon labelled ‘Pour subjuguer le monde.’
Amidst a background of smoke appear spears, and a
banner entitled ‘Horrors of Invasion.’ The Prussian eagle
is preparing to swoop down upon him, and, from under
the bed, crawls out a skeleton holding an hour-glass,
whilst round its fleshless arm is entwined a serpent ‘Intemperance,
Dropsy, Dissolution.’ John Bull, as a bull-dog,
is trying to seize Napoleon.</p>

<p>‘John Bull threatened by Insects from all Quarters’ is
by an unknown artist (April 1806). John Bull is on ‘The
tight little Island,’ and seated on a cask of grog. With
one hand he flourishes a cutlass, and the other grasps
a pistol, of which weapon two more lie on the ground.
With these he defies the insects, which come in swarms.
There are Westphalian mites, American hornets, Dutch
bluebottles, Italian butterflies, Turkish wasps, Danish gnats,
and, worst of all, a French dragon-fly, in the shape of
Napoleon. John Bull is saying: ‘Come on my Lads&mdash;give
me but good sea room, and I don’t care for any of you&mdash;Why
all your attacks is no more than a gnat stinging an
Elephant, or a flea devouring Mr. Lambert of Leicester.’</p>

<p>A very clever caricature is by Knight (June 26, 1806)
of ‘Jupiter Bouney granting unto the Dutch Frogs a
King. The Frogs sent their deputies to petition Jupiter
again for a King. He sent them a Stork, who eat them
up, vide Æsop’s fables.’ The discontented Dutch spurn
their King Log, and pray, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>‘We present ourselves before
the throne of your Majesty. We pray that you will grant
us, as the supreme Chief of our Republic, Prince Louis.’
Napoleon, as Jupiter, seated on an eagle (which is made to
look as much like a devil as possible), says: ‘I agree to the
request. I proclaim Prince Louis, King of Holland. You
Prince! reign over this People.’ And the stork is duly
despatched on its mission. Talleyrand, as Ganymede,
supplies Jupiter with <i>a cup of comfort for the discontented</i>.</p>

CAREER&mdash;HIS PROCLAMATION OF A BLOCKADE OF ENGLAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Apropos of the negotiations for peace, there is a picture
of Woodward’s (July 1806), in which Fox is just closing
the door behind a messenger laden with despatches. John
Bull, whose pockets are stuffed with <i>Omnium</i> and <i>Speculation
on Peace</i>, entreats him with clasped hands: ‘Now do
Charley, my dear good boy, open the door a little bit
farther, just to enable me to take in a few of my friends at
the Stock Exchange.’ But Fox remonstrates: ‘Really,
Mr. Bull, you are too inquisitive&mdash;don’t you see the door
for Negotiation is opened? don’t you see the back of a
Messenger? don’t you see he has got dispatches under his
arm? what would you desire more?’</p>

<p>‘Experiments at Dover, or Master Charley’s Magic
Lanthorn,’ is by Rowlandson (July 21, 1806), and shows
Fox seated on the seashore, projecting images on to the
opposite coast. The slide he is passing through the
lantern begins with a ‘Messenger from Boulogne,’ then a
‘Messenger to Paris,’ then ‘More Dispatches’; and he is
now showing Bonaparte as a newsboy, with his horn,
calling out ‘Preliminaries of Peace.’ The next, and final,
picture to come is a man waving his hat and shouting
‘Huzza.’ Fox is saying: ‘There, Master Bull, what do
you think of that&mdash;I told you I would surprize you. Preliminaries
of Peace! Huzza!’ But John Bull is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
quite satisfied with his conduct, and fancies there has been
something kept from him. ‘Why yes, it be all very foine,
if it be true. But I can’t forget that d&mdash;d Omnium last
week&mdash;they be always one way or other in contradictions!
I tell thee what, Charley, since thee hast become a great
man&mdash;I think in my heart thee beest always conjuring.’</p>

<p>‘The Pleasing and Instructive Game of <i>Messengers</i>&mdash;or
Summer Amusement for John Bull,’ by Ansell (August
1806), shows us the Channel, on both sides of which a
lively game is being kept up by means of racket bats, a
constant supply of balls, in the shape of messengers, between
the two countries, being kept in the air. Their
messages are Peace, Hope, Despair, No peace, Passports,
Peace to a Certainty, No peace, Credentials, Despatches,
&amp;c. On the French side, Napoleon and Talleyrand keep
the game alive, ‘Begar Talley, dis be ver amusant&mdash;Keep
it up as long as you can, that we may have time for our
project.’ Sheridan, Fox, and others play on the English
side; John Bull being merely a spectator, not too much
amused, as a paper, protruding from his pocket, shows:
‘Very shy at the Stock Exchange.’ Sheridan calls out:
‘That’s right my lads, bang ’em about. John Bull seems
quite puzzled.’ Fox asks: ‘Is not it a pretty game
Johnny?’ Johnny, however, says: ‘Pretty enough as to
that, they do fly about monstrous quick to be sure: but
you don’t get any more money out of my pocket for all
that!!’</p>

  <div class="caption">NEWS FROM CALABRIA.</div></div>

<p>Gillray gives us a veritable caricature in ‘News from
Calabria! Capture of Buenos Ayres! i.e. the Comforts of
an Imperial Dejeune at St. Clouds’ (September 13, 1806),
a portion only of which is given in illustration. Boney is
here, terrific in his wrath; poor Talleyrand, who has
brought the news, is receiving grievous punishment from
his Imperial master. Not only is his ear pulled (a favourite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
trick of Napoleon’s), but he is being belaboured with the
tea-urn, which is made in the form of the world: his
master crying out: ‘Out on ye Owl, noting but song of
Death!!’ Napoleon has kicked over the breakfast-table,
and the scalding contents of the tea-urn are being deposited
in the lap of Josephine, who screams with agony and
terror. The maids of honour and courtiers, though refraining
from open demonstration, look aghast at the imperial
violence, which is not diminished by the presence of a
number of messengers, whose news is particularly unwelcome:
‘Spain in despair for the loss of her Colonies.’ ‘All
Germany rising, and arming <i>en Masse</i>.’ ‘Holland starving,
and ripe for a revolt.’ ‘St. Petersburg: refusal to ratify the
French Treaty.’ ‘Prussia rousing from the Trance of
Death.’ ‘Swedish defiance. Charles XII. redivivus.’
‘Switzerland cursing the French yoke.’ ‘Italy shaking off
her Chains.’ ‘La Vendée again in motion.’ <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>‘Portugal
true to the last gasp.’ ‘Sicily firing like Etna.’ ‘Denmark
waiting for an opportunity.’ ‘Turkey invoking Mahomet.’
Naturally, all this bad news contributes towards making it
a ‘hard time’ for Talleyrand.</p>

<p>Argus gives us (September 1806) ‘The Continental
Shaving Shop. Boney beats Jemmy Wright, who shaved
as well as any man, almost, not quite’ (September 1806).
As a barber, he is going to shave the Grand Turk, and,
flourishing an enormous razor of Corsican steel, seizes his
beard. This the Turk naturally objects to, saying: ‘By
the Holy Prophet, I must not part with my beard, why,
my people will not acknowledge me for the grand Signor
again at Constantinople.’ Talleyrand, as assistant, is
lathering the Turk’s face, persuading him, ‘Come, come,
don’t make such a fuss, my Master <i>will</i> cut away when he
catches anybody in his shop.’ Boney calls out: ‘Lather
away Talley. I’ll soon ease him of his superfluities and
make him look like my Christian customers.’</p>

<p>The sort of treatment they are likely to get is clearly
set forth in an announcement on the wall. ‘Nap Boney,
shaver general to most of the Sovereigns on the Continent,
shaves expeditiously, and clean, a few gashes excepted; is
ready to undertake any new Customer who is willing to
submit to the above.’ His treatment is exemplified by
the appearance of Austria, whose gashed face and head is
ornamented with strips of court-plaister. He is talking to
John Bull, who looks in at a window: ‘Come, Johnny,
come in and be shaved, don’t be frightened at the size of
the razor, it cuts very clean, I assure you.’ His reply is,
‘By Goles so it seems, and leaves a dom’d sight of gashes
behoind, as you and Mynheer can testify!!’ Poor Holland
is in even a worse plight than Austria, and is talking to
Prussia, who is sitting in a chair, ready lathered for
shaving. Says he to the Dutchman: ‘I hope he don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
mean to shave me as he has you, and my neighbour
Austria there? I should not sit here so quietly with my
face lathered.’ Holland replies: ‘Yaw Mynheer very close
shaver, its nix my doll when you are used to it.’</p>

<p>‘Political Quadrille’ is by Ansell (October 1806), and
represents two sets playing that game of cards. One set is
composed of George the Third, Russia, Spain, and Prussia.
The other consists of Napoleon, Italy, Holland, and
Austria. George the Third says: ‘I never had luck when
the Curse of Scotland<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> was in my hand&mdash;however I have now
discarded it&mdash;Ay this will do&mdash;I have now a strong suit,
without a <i>knave</i> among them.’ Russia observes: ‘I never
had such luck since I have been a Russian, compleatly
bested off the board&mdash;but that I must endeavour to forget,
and try to play better in future.’ Spain says: ‘I was
obliged to play, tho’ it was <i>forced Spadille</i>. My Queen
deceived me&mdash;but however I must not now give myself
<i>Ayres</i>, as I have lost all my Dollars.’ Prussia remarks:
‘Shall I play or not? If I play, I fear I shall be bested,
and if not, they will call me <i>Prussian Cake</i>.’</p>

<p>In the other set of players, Napoleon says: ‘I begin to
fancy I can play alone&mdash;No, I can call a <i>King</i> when I
please, I am strong in my suits&mdash;besides I know how to
finesse my Cards.’ Austria says: ‘For the present I fear
the game is up with me, so I <i>pass</i>.’ Italy says: ‘I fear it
is nearly over with poor <i>Ponto</i>.’ Holland reflects: ‘I have
got a <i>King</i> without calling one&mdash;but I have no <i>Trump</i>
now, and I fear I shall lose all my fish.’</p>

<p>Fox died in September 1806, and was buried, October
10, in Westminster Abbey, close to the remains of his rival
Pitt. With him were buried the last hopes of a peace with
France, and, in October, finding all negotiations unsuccessful
(Great Britain requiring Russia to be made a party<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
to the Treaty, which France refused), Lord Lauderdale
demanded his passports, and left for England.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Napoleon marched on from victory to
victory. The battle of Jena, the occupation of Erfurth,
Greissen, Hall, Leipzig, Ascherleben, Bemburg, Spandau,
Potsdam, and, lastly, of Berlin, were all in his triumphal
march.</p>

<span class="i0">The fundamental law of France.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The decree is dated from Berlin, November 21, 1806,
and, after a preamble, states:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>‘1. The British Islands are
declared in a state of blockade. 2. All trade and intercourse
with the British Islands is prohibited; consequently
letters or packets addressed to England, or written in the
English language, will not be conveyed by post, and will
be seized. 3. Every native of England, whatever his rank
and condition, who may be found in the countries occupied
by our troops, or by those of our allies, shall be made
prisoners of war. 4. Every warehouse, and all merchandise
and property of any description whatever, belonging to an
English subject, or the produce of English manufactures
or colonies, is declared good prize. 5. Trade in English
merchandise is prohibited, and all merchandise belonging
to England, or the produce of her manufactures, and
colonies, is declared good prize. 6. One half of the produce
of the confiscation of the merchandise, and property,
declared good prize by the preceding articles, will be appropriated
to the indemnification of the merchants, for
losses they have sustained, through the capture of trading
vessels, by English cruisers. 7. No vessel coming directly
from England, or her colonies, or having been there since
the publication of the present decree, will be received in
any port. 8. Any vessel which, by means of a false declaration,
shall contravene the above article, shall be seized,
and the Ship and Cargo shall be confiscated as if they
were English property,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i>, of December 8, commenting on this proclamation,
says:&mdash;‘If our orders of Council, and our Navy
are not competent to seal up the ports of France, we
should be glad to know how Buonaparte, who can scarce
venture to <i>steal</i> a ship to sea, is to retaliate with effect
upon this country. We believe none of the nations, which
are yet free to trade with us, will be deterred by a Decree
emitted at Berlin, from sending their produce to the
markets of Britain. Of all the follies that have ever
escaped from Buonaparte, in the extravagance, and intoxication,
of his ambition, and success, this we consider as
one of the greatest. He, in fact, pledges himself to that
which he has no adequate means whatever of carrying into
effect. His Decree will have as little influence upon the
trade of England, as his Navy has.’</p>

<p>Ansell designed (December 1806) ‘Jack Tars conversing
with Boney on the Blockade of Old England.’
Napoleon is vapouring about behind his fortifications,
flourishing his sword, ‘The Terror of the Continent,’ and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
saying: ‘Begar by my Imperial decree, <i>England</i> is in a
State of Blockade.’ Two sailors are in a small boat called
the <i>Nelson</i>, and one says: ‘Why what do you mean by
that, you whipper snapper&mdash;Heres Tom Pipes, and I, in
this little cock boat, will Blockade you so that you dare
not bring out a single vessel&mdash;Blockade, indeed! you are
a pretty fellow to talk of blockading!’ His companion
contemptuously adds: ‘I wonder, Jack, you throw away
your precious time in talking to such a lubber.’ John Bull,
pipe in hand, stands on the cliffs of Albion, roaring with
laughter. ‘I cannot help laughing at the whimsical conceit.’</p>

<p>Souley (December 1806) drew ‘Bonaparte blockading
John Bull.’</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">Boney for want of proper Sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By threats bombastic would prevail.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Boney and his army are crossing the Channel in their
cocked hats; he, presenting sword and pistol at John Bull,
says: ‘I’ll Blockade ye, ye English Scoundrel. ’Tis you
thwart all my designs&mdash;’Tis you and you only who dare
oppose <span class="smcap smaller">MY WILL</span>. But I’ll Blockade ye&mdash;and not one of
your rascally Craft shall stir.’ John Bull, convulsed with
laughter, is dancing, and saying: ‘Shiver my timbers,
here’s a go! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Why Master Boney
you look like Neptune crossing the <i>Line</i>. I suppose
next you will be blockading the moon.’</p>

<p>And so ends the year 1806.</p>

<span class="subhead">NAPOLEON’S POLISH CAMPAIGN&mdash;BATTLE OF EYLAU&mdash;MEETING OF THE
EMPERORS AT TILSIT&mdash;CAPTURE OF THE DANISH FLEET.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>1807 commences with ‘<span class="smcap">John Bull</span> playing on the <span class="smcap">Base</span>
Villain’ (artist unknown, January 1, 1807), in which
we see that revered personage playing ‘Britains Strike
home’ on poor Boney, with a sword in lieu of a bow, and
grasping him tightly round the neck.</p>

<p>In November 1806, Napoleon, with his army, had
entered Poland, and, on December 18 of the same year, he
entered Warsaw.</p>

<p>An unknown artist (January 1807) depicts ‘The
Entrance into Poland or another Bonne Bouche for Boney.’
On their knees are the Polish magnates, who exclaim:
‘What a happy day for Poland!’ The foremost is kissing
the toe of Napoleon, who says: ‘Rise up <i>free</i> and <i>independent</i>
Polanders, depend upon it you shall have a King,
and I’ll be Vice Roy <i>over him</i>.’ Behind, a standard-bearer
carries a flag, on which is shown a pair of shackles, a
guillotine, and two crossed swords, with the legend, ‘Comfort
for the Poles.’ Beside him, another French soldier is
emptying a sack of fetters.</p>

<p>The Russians withdrew for a time, but only to return
in force, and Napoleon had to change his tactics to meet
them; he therefore proposed to concentrate his forces,
and compel the Russians to give battle, with the Vistula in
their rear, and he himself between them and Russia. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
despatches, however, were intercepted, and the battle was
precipitated. Augereau’s division lost its way, and was cut
up by the Russians; and Bernadotte did not come, as
the despatches, bidding him do so, had been captured.
The fight in the snow at Preuss Eylau was fearful, and
the carnage, especially in the churchyard, was horrible.
Four thousand men died there. The French put down
their loss in this battle as 2,000 killed, 6,000 wounded;
while the loss of the Russians was 7,000 dead, 16,000
wounded, 12,000 prisoners, and 45 cannon taken.</p>

<p>That the blockade still galled us is evidenced by a
caricature of Woodward’s (January 27, 1807), who designed
‘The Giant Commerce overwhelming the Pigmy Blockade.’
Commerce is a strange figure: its cap is <i>Wedgwood ware</i>,
its face <i>Staffordshire ware</i>, its eyes <i>Derby Porcelain</i>, and
its mouth <i>Worcester porcelain</i>. Its body is <i>Wool</i>, arms of
<i>printed calico</i>, and its hands are encased in <i>Woodstock gloves</i>.
It wears a <i>Norwich shawl</i>, has <i>leather</i> breeches, <i>Fleecy
hosiery</i> stockings, and <i>Staffordshire</i> shoes. It is actively
employed in hurling various missiles at Napoleon, who is
sheltered behind his fortifications. These implements of
offence consist of such articles as <i>Birmingham steel</i>, <i>pig
iron</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>combs</i>, <i>knives and forks</i>, <i>block tin</i>, <i>sugar</i>,
<i>patent coffins</i>, <i>Birmingham buttons</i>, and a cask each of
<i>London porter</i>, <i>Maidstone</i>, <i>Geneva</i>, and <i>British spirits</i>.
Napoleon entreats: ‘Pray Mr. Commerce don’t overwhelm
me, and I will take off de grande Blockade of old England.’</p>

<p>The two following caricatures were designed and published
before the news had arrived in England of the
crushing defeat of the Russians at Eylau, which only
appeared publicly in the ‘Times’ of March 10.</p>

<p>Ansell (March 1807) gives ‘Boney and his Army in
Winter Quarters.’ In the background is a <i>State Prison for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Prisoners of War</i>; and, in the centre of the picture, the
Russian bear hugs poor Boney, and prepares to drop him
in the river Bug, in which is a board inscribed, ‘Hic Jacet.
Snug in the Bug several thousands of the great nation.’
Bruin growls: ‘Hush a bye! Hush a bye! take it all
quietly, you’ll soon find yourself as snug as a bug in a rug.’
But Boney, writhing in the embrace, cries out: ‘Oh D&mdash;n
the Bug, I wish I had never seen it. My dear Talley&mdash;don’t
tell my faithful subjects the true state of my situation.
Any thing but the truth, my dear Talley&mdash;Oh this
Cursed Russian bear, how close he hugs me.’ Talleyrand,
with one foot in the Vistula, and the other on land,
replies: ‘Leave me alone for a Bulletin’&mdash;applies his lips
to a trumpet, from which issues a true and a false report.
The true one, ‘4000 prisoners, 3000 drowned, 12 Eagles
taken, 12000 killed,’ is disappearing into thin air; whilst
that ‘For Paris’ is as follows: ‘Grand Bulletin. The
august Emperor of the great Nation informs his faithful,
and beloved, subjects, that, having performed wonders on
the banks of the Bug, he has now closed a glorious campaign
for the season, and retired with ease, and comfort,
into Winter quarters.’</p>

<p>‘The Political Cock horse’ (Souley, March 10, 1807)
shows Napoleon’s somewhat ragged white charger stumbling
over a stone, ‘Insatiable Ambition.’ Benningsen has
jumped up behind him, seized the reins, and hurled Boney
to the ground. In his fall he loses his sword ‘Oppression,’
and cries out pitifully, ‘Stop, stop, good Benningsen, don’t
kill a poor fellow! An Armistice! an Armistice! I have
very good proposals of peace for you.’ But the relentless
Russian prepares to run him through with his sword,
saying: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>‘You Bombastic Scoundrel, Robber, Murderer,
Violator, Incendiary, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. You thought of reigning
with your Iron Crown (in) the North, as well as the
South. But know, Tyrant, that the Sons of the North are
to be your Superior.’ John Bull encourages him with
‘Bravo, bravo, brave Russians: One home stroke more,
and good bye to Master Boney.’</p>

  <div class="caption">THE NEW DYNASTY, OR THE LITTLE CORSICAN GARDENER PLANTING
A ROYAL PIPPIN TREE.</div></div>

<p>Of Gillray’s caricature of ‘The New Dynasty; or the
little Corsican Gardener Planting a Royal Pippin Tree,’
only a portion is given&mdash;that relating to Napoleon. The
Old Royal Oak is being hewn down by ‘All the Talents,’
and Talleyrand is busy digging a hole to receive Napoleon’s
royal pippin, which is to take its place. The topmost
pippin, which is crowned, represents Lord Moira, who
claimed to be descended from the old kings of Ballynahinch.
The others are, ‘Countess of Salisbury beheaded
1505,’ ‘Duchess of Cleves put to death in 1453,’ ‘Henry de
la Pole beheaded in 1538,’ ‘Plantagenet beheaded in 1415,’
‘Crookback Richard killed at Bosworth,’ <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>‘Edmund, 4th
son of Henry 2, beheaded.’ The royal pippins behind,
which have already been planted, and have taken root, are
labelled respectively, ‘Etruria, Wurtemburg, Saxon, Holland,
and Italian;’ whilst on the ground, by a basket, are grafts,
which respectively represent Sir Francis Burdett, Cobbett,
and Horne Tooke.</p>

<p>Napoleon pursued his victories over the Russians.
Dantzig was taken; at Friedland the Russians lost 18,000
men and 25 generals, killed and wounded, and at last
Königsberg was taken by Soult, after having been evacuated
by the Russians. It was time for them to beg for an
armistice, and on June 21 one was concluded. Napoleon
was asked to have an interview with the Emperor of Russia,
to which he consented, and Tilsit was the place appointed;
and, in order that this meeting should be quite private, and
free from interruption, Napoleon ordered a large raft to be
moored in the middle of the Niemen, on which was erected
a room with two antechambers, all elegantly furnished and
decorated. Both the roof and the doors were ornamented
with French and Russian eagles. On June 25 they met;
Napoleon reached the raft first, and stood on its edge to
welcome Alexander. They met and parted in a most
friendly manner. This incident, it is needless to say,
afforded a fine subject to the caricaturist.</p>

<p>Ansell gives us, certainly, a more comic representation
of the meeting of the Emperors than any other caricaturist
(July 1807). Bonaparte is hugging the Emperor of Russia
in a most exaggerated style, saying: ‘My dear Brother&mdash;receive
this Fraternal Embrace out of pure affection.’ But
Russia, finding the raft tilting violently, and not liking such
demonstrative affection, exclaims, ‘Zounds, Brother, you’ll
squeeze me to death&mdash;besides, I find my side of the raft is
sinking very fast.’ Poor Prussia is floundering in the water,
his crown floating away from him: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>‘What a Prussian cake
I was to listen to him&mdash;I am afraid I shall never recover
it.’</p>

<p>Ansell drew (July 1807) ‘An Imperial Bonne bouche,
or the dinner at Tilsit.’ Napoleon, attended by his guards,
sits on one side of the table, and the Emperor of Russia
opposite to him; the latter has but an empty plate, and a
castor of cayenne pepper before him, whilst Napoleon is
stuffing his mouth with ‘Continental slices,’ and has besides,
immediately before him, ‘Austerlitz biscuit,’ ‘Friedland
Pye,’ and ‘Eylau Custard,’ which he intends carving with
his sword. But he banters his brother Emperor with ‘My
dear Brother, you dont eat; What is the matter with you?
see what a hearty meal our other beloved Cousin, and
brother, is making, from the Crumbs that fall from the
table.’ And Prussia is seen on his knees, picking up some
fragments of a ‘Prussian Cake.’ Russia, with expectant
knife and fork, looks very blankly at his <i>confrère</i>, and replies:
‘How the deuce, brother, am I to eat when you keep
everything to yourself?’</p>

<p>‘Mutual Honors at Tilsit, or the Monkey, the Bear and
the Eagle’ (August 1807), by Ansell, represents Napoleon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
as a monkey, seated on a drum, having a plaque upon his
breast, inscribed ‘Order of St. Andrew, to our Faithful &amp;c.
&amp;c. &amp;c. Fudge,’ decorating a bear with ‘The Legion of
Honor. To our trusty and beloved Cousin &amp;c. &amp;c. Fudge.’
The poor bear wears a fool’s cap and bells, and is muzzled,
whilst its throat is galled by a spiked collar, called, in irony,
‘Collar of Independence.’ Napoleon says, ‘Really, Brother
Bruin&mdash;you never look’d so fine in your life. You cannot
think how the medal, and cap and bells, become you.’
But the bear ruefully ruminates, ‘I shall really be ashamed
to return to my own Fraternity. I wonder what my old
Friend, the Lion, will say.’ The Prussian eagle is also
decorated with the collar of the Legion of Honour, but is
in a wofully dilapidated condition, which is well explained
by its own reflections: ‘It is certainly very fine&mdash;but, what
with having one of my heads chopped off&mdash;and the crown
half cracked of the other; besides having my wings cropp’d,
I think, somehow, I was better off before.’</p>

<p>The English, perforce, had to keep up their courage,
and one etching, by Ansell (August 1807), represents, in the
background, Napoleon on his throne, and all the European
sovereigns grovelling before him. The foreground is occupied
by Britannia and John Bull. The former asks: ‘Do
give me your advice&mdash;what am I to do&mdash;All my foreign
Allies have deserted me,&mdash;even Russia has joined them,
they are bending at the feet of the usurper.’ John Bull, a
truculent-looking sailor, with oaken Cudgel, replies: ‘What
are you to do? Why stick to me, your old and faithful
ally John Bull, who will never desert you while he has a
timber to support him.’ The picture is called ‘Britannia
in tribulation for the loss of her Allies, or John Bull’s
advice.’</p>

<p>In ‘The Polish Pie, or the Effects of the Peace at
Tilsit’ (artist unknown, September 10, 1807), we see the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Emperor of Russia, and Napoleon, carving a huge ‘Polish
pie,’ the Russian’s opinion of which is ‘I think I never
relished a Pie so well in all my life.’ Whilst thus engaged,
comes poor, wounded, tattered Prussia, humbly, with hat in
hand: ‘Pray give a part of the Pie to a poor broken-down
Prussian&mdash;You know you promised me formerly you would
not touch it; but now you have reduced me to poverty,
crutches, and a wooden leg&mdash;you’ll not allow me a mouthfull,
’tis a very hard case indeed! Pray remember a poor
Prussian!’ Napoleon turns to his brother Emperor, and
opines, ‘Suppose, Cousin, we give him a small piece of the
<i>Crust</i>, just to keep him from grumbling.’</p>

<p>The Danes sought to curry favour with Napoleon, or
perhaps they were obliged to act as they did; but they
closed their ports, such as Holstein, &amp;c., to British ships,
which John Bull could not stand. So Admiral Gambier,
with a fleet, having on board 20,000 troops, sailed to set
matters right. Negotiations failed, and the admiral used
the <i>force majeure</i> at his disposal. Copenhagen was bombarded,
and on September 8 the British took possession of
the fortifications, &amp;c., of Copenhagen, captured the whole
Danish fleet, fully armed and equipped, consisting of 18
sail of the line, 15 frigates, 6 brigs, and 25 gun-boats,
which were safely navigated to England, with the exception
of one ship, which was stranded. Unfortunately, Copenhagen
itself suffered severely, guns not being so scientifically
constructed as at present, and accuracy as to range was
impossible.</p>

<p>‘Gulliver towing the Fleet into Lilliput!’ (I. Cruikshank,
October 16, 1807) shows Admiral Gambier swimming
towards England, towing the captured vessels. George
the Third, on a Martello tower, watching him through his
spy-glass, and saying, with his accustomed iteration, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>‘What,
What, Gulliver the 2nd&mdash;he&mdash;Gulliver the 2nd&mdash;More
Nelsons&mdash;more Nelsons&mdash;brave fellows!’ On the Continent
Napoleon is seen furious, and the countries under his
sway are in different attitudes of despair. Napoleon shouts
out, ‘Curse that fellow; here, Tally, stop him: what! will
nobody stop him? Then begar, we never shall invade
England, and all our schemes are frustrated.’ On the coast
of Zealand a Jack Tar is thus explaining to a native: ‘Hold
your jaw; You know as how you used to rob our forefathers,
you lubber, and so you wanted to assist that
French Monkey to do it again, but it would not do.’</p>

<p>Ansell published (October 21, 1807) ‘Malignant Aspects
looking with envy on John Bull and his Satellites, or, a
New Planetary System.’ In a centre medallion sits John
Bull, happily smoking, and with a jug of good October by
his side. He is surrounded by the British navy, and a halo
of glory. Rushing towards him is ‘A Corsican Comet
Frenchified,’ and chained to him is ‘A Russian bear with
two heads, an appendage to the Comet.’ There is a
‘Danish Mouse,’ an ‘Italian Greyhound,’ an ‘American
Torpedo,’ a ‘Swiss Cheese,’ a ‘Spanish Puff,’ a ‘Dutch
frog,’ besides many <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>‘minor Constellations with malignant
aspects.’</p>

<blockquote class="inhead center">

<p>FRENCH ENTRY INTO PORTUGAL&mdash;BLOCKADE OF ENGLAND&mdash;FLIGHT OF
THE PORTUGUESE ROYAL FAMILY&mdash;THE PENINSULAR WAR&mdash;FLIGHT OF
KING JOSEPH.</p></blockquote>

<p>On October 18 or 19 Junot entered Portugal, and then it
was that John Bull began to fear for his stock of port wine.
This is very amusingly put in a picture: ‘In Port, and Out
of Port, or news from Portugal,’ which is the title of a caricature
by Woodward (November 10, 1807), and it represents
Bonaparte seated on a pipe of ‘Genuine Old Port.’
With folded arms he thus speaks: ‘Now Master Jean Bull&mdash;more
news for you. You’ll soon be out of Port.’ A
miserable-looking ‘Portugee’ approaches John Bull, with
cap in hand, saying: ‘I be, d’ye see, de poor Portuguese.
Vat he mean be de Port Wine; which he will be glad to
change for your bag of guineas dere&mdash;begar&mdash;but dat is
mine&mdash;between ourselves.’ John Bull, who is sitting down,
smoking, with a jug of ale and a huge bagful of guineas
by his side, replies: ‘D&mdash;n him, and his <i>Port</i> too&mdash;I am
snug in <i>Port</i>, and while I have the port holes of my wooden
walls, and a glass of home brew’d ale, his conquests shall
never trouble me.’</p>

<p>Napoleon, in a decree dated from Hamburg, November
10, and also in another dated Milan, December 27, again
declared England in a state of blockade, and he made all
under his sway to cease all connection with that country,
as far as commercial matters were concerned; and this is
how the caricaturist met <span class="locked">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
‘Blockade against Blockade, or John Bull a Match for
Boney’ (Ansell, November 1807), shows the different sides
of a ‘Wall of Blockade.’ John Bull is well victualled, and
has a fine surloin of beef, and a full tankard, &amp;c.; and he
says: ‘Now Master Boney, we shall see which will hold
out the longest, my wall against yours. Aye, aye, I can
see you. I have left a peep hole. I believe you will soon
be glad to change your Soup Maigre for my Roast beef.’
Boney, with only a basin of Soup Maigre before him, looks
very disconsolate: ‘Who could have thought that he would
build a wall also&mdash;I really think I had better have left him
alone&mdash;Some how I don’t relish this Soup Maigre.’</p>

<p>‘The Continental Dockyard,’ by Woodward (November
27, 1807), shows a very tumbledown erection, called ‘The
Gallic Storehouse for English Shipping,’ but it contains
none. It only holds the ‘Yaw Mynheer,’ the ‘Don Diego,’
the ‘Swede,’ the ‘Dane,’ and the ‘Napoleon,’ on which a
number of shipwrights are engaged, being driven to their
task by Napoleon, with drawn sword. He thus addresses
the master shipwright: ‘Begar you must work like de
Diable, ve must annihilate dis John Bull.’ The unlucky
foreman replies: ‘Please you, my Grand Empereur, ’tis no
use vatever. As fast as ve do build dem, he vas clap dem
in his storehouse over de way.’ Accordingly, we see in
‘John Bull’s Storehouse’ a large collection of captured
vessels from the Armada&mdash;‘Portobello,’ ‘Camperdown,’
‘St. Vincent,’ ‘Nile,’ and ‘Trafalgar.’ John Bull and a
number of sailors enjoy this cheering sight. Says he to
them: ‘I say my lads, if he goes on this way we shall be
overstocked.’ And a sailor remarks: ‘What a deal of
pains some people take for nothing.’</p>

<p>I. Cruikshank (December 20, 1807) gives us ‘The
Bear, the Monkey, the Turkey, and the Bull, or the true
cause of the Russian war.’ Bonaparte, as the French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Monkey, is leading the Russian Bear by a collar and chain,
and thus addresses him: ‘The case is this, if you will make
war against that overgrown Bull over the way, you shall
have a slice of that fine Turkey! and the Eastern Star.’
The Turkey is represented as saying: ‘I wish I was well
out of their clutches, but I am afraid they will have me at
last.’ The <i>Eastern Star</i> appears on the horizon, and represents
the Indies. A Bull, on the opposite coast, is in a
menacing attitude, and bellows forth: ‘You had better
beware, for, remember the old adage&mdash;When you play
with a Bull, take care of his horns.’</p>

<p>‘John Bull refreshing the Bear’s Memory’ is by I.
Cruikshank (December 20, 1807), and shows the former
worthy opening an enormous volume, his journal, and thus
addressing a crowned bear, who has a collar round his
neck inscribed ‘This bear belongs to Napoleon,’ and who
regards the book through an enormous pair of spectacles.
‘So you say, Master Bruin, that my visit to Denmark has no
parallel in History&mdash;do be so good as to turn your spectacles
to this page, and refresh your memory.’ And he points
to a page of his journal, in which is written: ‘The Great,
the Magnanimous, Catherine of Russia seized upon one
third of the Kingdom of Poland, and kept it to herself.
These peaceful Danes seized on the City of Hamburgh.’</p>

<p>On January 1, 1808, I. Cruikshank published ‘Boney
stark mad, or more Ships, Colonies, and Commerce.’ It
shows the fleet in the Tagus, and the British Admiral (Sir
Sidney Smith) calling out through his speaking-trumpet,
‘Bon jour, Monsieur, if you would like a trip to the Brazils,
I’ll conduct you there with a great deal of pleasure; perhaps
you would like a taste of Madeira by the way.’ This
is to Talleyrand, on whom Bonaparte is venting his rage,
kicking him, and tearing off his wig, saying: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>‘Stop them,
stop them. Murder, fire! Why did you not make more
haste, you hopping rascal? now, all my hopes are blasted,
my revenge disappointed, and&mdash;I’ll glut it on you&mdash;Monster&mdash;Vagabond&mdash;Villain!!!’</p>

<p>The explanation of this caricature is, that as the French
army was marching direct to Lisbon, the whole of the Portuguese
Royal family embarked for the Brazils, on November
29, under convoy of a British squadron.</p>

<p>‘Delicious Dreams! Castles in the Air! Glorious
Prospects! vide an Afternoon Nap after the Fatigues of
an Official Dinner,’ is by Gillray (April 10, 1808), and
shows the Cabinet asleep, a punch-bowl on the table, and
full and empty bottles all around. They are so quiet that
the mice are licking the Treasury plates. Behind Castlereagh’s
chair is a cat (Catalani). Mr. Perceval sleeps with
his arms on the table; the Duke of Portland in the chairman’s
seat; Lord Liverpool with his back to the table;
Canning, negligently lolling back in his chair, uses Lord
Melville, who is under the table, as a footstool. The
delicious dream they see has for its background the Tower
of London, before which passes Britannia seated on a
triumphal car, fashioned somewhat like a ship, and drawn
by a bull; and, behind the car, chained to it, come, first,
Bonaparte, the Russian Bear, Prussia, Austria, and Spain.</p>

<p>‘The Corsican Tiger at Bay’ (Rowlandson, July 8,
1808) shows Napoleon as a Tiger (or rather, as the artist
has depicted him, a leopard), with his fore-feet on four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
<i>Royal Greyhounds</i>, whilst a pack of <i>Patriotic Greyhounds</i>
are rushing to attack him. John Bull, standing on the
white cliffs of Albion, presents his gun at him, singing the
nursery <span class="locked">rhyme&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

</div>

<p class="in0">D&mdash;me, but we’ll manage him amongst us.’ The <i>Russian
Bear</i> and <i>Austrian Eagle</i> are chained together; but Austria
thus proposes: ‘Now, Brother Bruin, is the time to break
our chains.’ The Dutch frog, too, joins in the chorus: ‘It
will be my turn to have a slap at him next.’</p>

<p>‘Boney Bothered, or an unexpected meeting’ (Ansell,
July 9, 1808). This shows Boney having gone right
through the world, and, coming out on the other side,
planting his foot on the East Indies, at Bengal; but he is
utterly astonished to find John Bull there also, armed with
his redoubtable oaken cudgel. ‘Begar,’ says he, ‘Monsieur
Jean Bull again! Vat! you know I was come here?’
To which John Bull, from whose pocket peeps a bundle of
<i>Secret Intelligence</i>, replies, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>‘To be sure I did&mdash;for all your
humbug deceptions. I smoked<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> your intentions, and have
brought my Oak Twig with me, so now you may go back
again.’</p>

<p>We now come to a period of our history which is interesting
to all of us&mdash;the Peninsular War. Napoleon had
turned his attention to Spain, and the Spanish king had
abdicated, and been sent to Fontainebleau, with ample
allowances. Joseph Bonaparte had been chosen king of
Spain, and Murat had his kingdom of Naples. But the
Spanish nation did not acquiesce in these arrangements.
They broke into open revolt, the English helping them
with arms and money, and, on June 6, the Supreme Junta
formally declared war against Napoleon. This much is
necessary to explain the following <span class="locked">caricature:&mdash;</span></p>

<div id="ip_80" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="600" height="449" alt="" /></div>

<p>Gillray (July 11, 1808) drew ‘The Spanish Bull fight,
or the Corsican Matador in danger,’ and kindly tells us
that ‘The Spanish Bull is so remarkable for Spirit, that,
unless the Matador strikes him dead at the first blow, the
Bull is sure to destroy him.’ In the <i>Theatre Royale de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
l’Europe</i> sits George the Third, a trident in one hand, his
spy-glass in the other, keenly watching the exciting fight,
as also are the delighted sovereigns of Europe, the Pope,
the Sultan of Turkey, and the Dey of Algiers. The
Spanish Bull has broken the Corsican chain and collar
which bound him, and, trampling on his king, has gored
and tossed the Matador, Napoleon, whose sword is broken
in an ineffectual attempt to despatch the animal. On the
ground are three wounded bulls&mdash;Prussian, Dutch, and
Danish&mdash;bellowing for help.</p>

<p>Woodward gives us a capital caricature in ‘The Corsican
Spider in his web’ (July 12, 1808). Napoleon is there
represented as a bloated spider, ‘Unbounded ambition,’
and he is just swallowing a Spanish fly. There are plenty
of flies in his web&mdash;Austrian, Dutch, Portuguese, Hanoverian,
Etrurian, Prussian, Hamburg, Italian, Venetian,
and small flies innumerable. The Pope fly is just being
entangled, and says, ‘I am afraid I shall be dragg’d in.’
‘The Russian Fly’ has touched the fatal web, and exclaims,
‘I declare I was half in the web before I made the
discovery.’ In fact, the only two that are as yet free from
the baneful mesh is the Turkish fly, who thinks, ‘I am afraid
it will be my turn next,’ and the British fly, who, well and
hearty, calls out, ‘Ay, you may look, master Spider, but I
am not to be caught in your web.’</p>

<p>To understand the next caricature, which, though dated
July 27, must have been published somewhat later, we
must note that Joseph Bonaparte entered Madrid, in state,
on July 20, but, ominously, without any welcome from the
<i>people</i>: although money was scattered broadcast, none but
the French picked it up. He knew little of what was
going on&mdash;how Moncey had been obliged to raise the
siege of Valencia, and that Dupont had surrendered at
Baylen. This latter piece of news he did not receive till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the 26th or 27th of July; when he learned also that Castaños,
with constantly increasing forces, was marching towards
Madrid, he left that city for Vittoria.</p>

<p>A broadside caricature (artist unknown, July 27, 1808)
shows Joseph leaving Madrid, his crown falling off, heading
his troops, who are carrying off heaps of treasure. It is
headed ‘Burglary and Robbery!!! Whereas on the night
of the 20th of July last, a numerous gang of French
Banditti entered the City of Madrid, and burglariously
broke into the Royal Palace, National Bank, and most of
the Churches thereof, murdering all who opposed them in
their infamous proceedings.</p>

<p>‘The said banditti remained in Madrid until the 27th
of the said month, and then suddenly departed, laden
with immense booty, having stolen from thence several
waggon-loads of plate, and every portable article of
value, taking the road to France; all patriotic Spaniards
are hereby requested to be aiding, and assisting, in the
apprehension of all, or any, of the said robbers; and,
whoever apprehends all, or any, of them, shall receive
the thanks, and blessings, of every well-disposed person
in Europe.</p>

<p>‘The said Banditti were headed by <i>Joe Nap</i>, a ferocious
ruffian of the following description:&mdash;He is about five feet
seven inches high, of a meagre, squalid aspect, saffron-coloured
complexion. He was, when he escaped, habited
in a <i>royal robe</i>, which he is known to have stolen from the
King’s Wardrobe at Naples. He is a brother of the <i>noted
thief</i> who has committed numberless robberies all over
Europe, <i>murdered millions of the human race</i>, and who was
latterly at Bayonne, where it is supposed he tarried, for the
purpose of <i>receiving the stolen goods</i> which his brother was
to bring from Spain.’</p>

<p>The war, in aid of Spain, against France, was now taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
up in earnest, and Sir Arthur Wellesley was sent to Spain
with a large body of troops, whilst reinforcements were to
come from other quarters.</p>

<p>Almost one of the last of Gillray’s political caricatures,
and a very good one it is, is ‘Apotheosis of the Corsican
Phœnix’ (August 2, 1808). It has an imaginary quotation
from a supposed ‘New Spanish Encyclopædia, edit. 1808.
When the Phœnix is tired of Life, he builds a Nest upon
the mountains, and setting it on Fire by the wafting of his
own Wings, he perishes Himself in the Flames! and from
the smoke of his Ashes arises a new <i>Phœnix</i> to illumine
the world!!!’ This very graphic etching shows, on the
summit of the Pyrenees, a globe, which is the nest of the
Phœnix&mdash;Napoleon, with orb and sceptre, but, his crown
falling off, he has fanned all Europe into a blaze with his
wings. Around his neck is a ‘cordon d’honneur’ of
daggers, and, amid the smoke which rises from the pyre, is
seen a dove with olive branch, having on its wings ‘Peace
on earth.’</p>

<p>I. Cruikshank still kept up the idea of <i>Tiddy-Doll</i> in
‘The Oven on Fire&mdash;or Boney’s last Batch entirely
spoiled!!!’ (August 24, 1808.) He is on his knees, with
arms outspread in consternation, for, in putting Dupont, on
a ‘peel,’ into the oven&mdash;‘Spain and Portugal’&mdash;flames
burst out, labelled Asturian Legions, Army of Portugal,
Biscay, Catalonian Army, Army of Galicia, Andalusian
Army, Army of New and Old Castille, British Army and
Fleet, Estramadurean Army, Leon, Army of Valencia,
Murcia, and Army of Granada; whilst in the centre of the
flames is the legend ‘A people United can never be conquered.’
Poor Dupont exclaims, ‘Oh Nap, Nap! what is
this? Instead of a King, you’ve only made me a Dup(e)ont.’
Bonaparte himself cries out, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>‘Zounds, I shall be overwhelmed
with this Patriotic Blaze. I did not think there
was a single spark left, but I find there is more than all
the Engines of France can extinguish.’ Talleyrand, who
stands by his kneading-trough, which is labelled ‘State
Prison,’ rests quiet, and says, ‘Aye Aye, I told you that you
would burn your fingers at that batch of Ginger-bread&mdash;but
I have nothing to do with it. I am only a <i>Jailor</i>, so
there is an end to all my glory.’</p>

<p>We have seen the European monarchs sitting down to a
game of quadrille. Ansell (August 1808) gives us its conclusion.
Spain has suddenly arisen, and, upsetting the table,
seizes Napoleon by the throat, accusing him of foul play:
‘I tell you, you are a Scoundrel, and if you do not restore
my King, whom you have stolen from the other table, and
reinstate <i>Ponto</i>&mdash;by the honor of a Spanish Patriot, I will
strangle you.’ Trembling Bonaparte replies, ‘Don’t be so
boisterous, I only borrowed him, merely to make up the
pack.’ The Pope is on the floor, and the stolid Dutchman,
with his hat in hand, says, ‘Donder and Blixens, I be
quite tired of de game. Yaw! Yaw! now is de time for
me to rise.’ At the other table all take a lively interest in
the squabble. George the Third rises from his seat and
grasps his ‘heart of oak’ stick, saying, ‘What! what! a
dust, eh? so much the better. Boney got the worst of the
game. I must lend a hand.’ Russia, with hand on sword,
turns in his chair, remarking that ‘Now is the time to rub
off the rust of Tilsit.’ Prussia rises, exclaiming, ‘If I don’t
take advantage of the present opportunity, I shall indeed
be a Prussian Cake.’ Austria reaches his hat and sword
from its peg on the wall, and says, ‘Ah! Ah! the game
has taken a different turn from what I expected, I must
not be idle.’</p>

<p>The next caricature relates to the bad success of Napoleon’s
arms. The raising the siege of Saragossa, the defeat
of Vimiera, and the Convention of Cintra, by which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
French were to evacuate Portugal, were not facts likely to
be relished in France.</p>

<p>‘The Fox and the Grapes’ is another of Woodward’s
(September 15, 1808), where the Corsican Fox interviews
the Gallic Cock. The former says, ‘Believe me, my dear
Doodle doo, you would not like them&mdash;I found them so
<i>sour</i> that I absolutely could not <i>touch</i> them,’ in answer to
the Cock’s query&mdash;‘But my good friend, you promised to
bring me home some Spanish Grapes and Portugal plums:
where are they?’</p>

<p>‘Prophecy explained’ is by Rowlandson (September
17, 1808), and the text taken is from the Revelation of
St. John (chap. xvii. verse 10): ‘And there are seven
kings, five are fallen, and <i>one</i> is, and the other is not yet
come, and when he cometh he must continue but a short
space.’ The five that are fallen are the Kings of Würtemberg,
Saxony, Holland, Bavaria, and Prussia, and these
have fallen into a ‘Slough of Disgrace and Ridicule.’ The
‘<i>one</i> that is,’ it is needless to say, is Napoleon; and the
‘one that continued but a short space,’ is King Joseph, who,
having been chased beyond the Pyrenees, has his crown
snatched from him. There are many other caricatures
on this subject of the flight of Joseph, but, although interesting,
they hardly come within the scope of <i>personal</i> satire
on Napoleon.</p>

<p>Rowlandson gives us (September 20, 1808) ‘Napoleon
the little in a Rage with his great French Eagle!!’
Napoleon, with his sword drawn, and his hands clenched,
is in a terrible rage with his brother Joseph, who, under
the guise of a crowned eagle, is limping along with one
leg in a sling. Napoleon thus addresses him: ‘Confusion
and Destruction&mdash;what is this I see? Did I not command
you not to return till you had spread your Wing of Victory
over the whole Spanish Nation?’ And the poor bird<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
meekly replies: ‘Aye, its fine talking Nap, but if you had
been there, you would not much have liked it&mdash;The
Spanish Cormorants pursued me in such a manner, that
they not only disabled one of my legs, but set me a
moulting in such a terrible way that I wonder I had not
lost every feather; besides, it got so hot, I could not bear
it any longer.’</p>

<p>There is a caricature (September 24, 1808) of ‘A hard
passage, or Boney playing Base on the Continent.’ He is
here represented as playing on the bass viol from the score
of the ‘Conquest of Spain and Portugal.’ His task seems
hard, and he exclaims: ‘Plague take it! I never met with
so difficult a <i>passage</i> before. But, if I can once get over

<p>‘The Valley of the Shadow of Death’ is, as far as I know,
the last caricature of Gillray (September 24, 1808) in connection
with Napoleon&mdash;if, indeed, it can be called a caricature,
for it is far too serious in its conception. Napoleon’s
situation at the moment is here firmly grasped.
He is surrounded by enemies. With notched sword in
hand, he leads the Russian bear. He is pursued by the
German eagle and the spirit of Charles XII. Above is the
‘Turkish New Moon Rising in blood,’ the obscured portion
of which is represented by ‘French Influence,’ the bright
crescent as ‘English Influence,’ and the whole is dropping
blood. A fiery comet, with a tiara as a nucleus (the Pope),
is darting thunderbolts of excommunication upon him;
whilst Junot and Dupont, shackled together at their necks,
amidst clouds, seem to warn him of his fate. Immediately
in front of him is a <i>Portuguese wolf</i>, which has broken its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
chain, a <i>Sicilian terrier</i>, and the <i>Leo Britannicus</i>. Death
also appears, lance in one hand, hour-glass in the other, on
a mule of ‘True Royal Spanish breed.’ In the Ditch of
Styx is disappearing ‘Rex Joseph,’ whose hands and crown
alone appear above water. Creeping upwards from the
slime of the <i>Lethean Ditch</i>, is ‘The Rhenish Confederation
of starved Rats, crawling out of the Mud,’ also ‘Dutch
Frogs spitting out their spite’; whilst the ‘American
Rattle Snake is shaking his tail,’ and the ‘Prussian scarecrow
is attempting to fly.’</p>

<p>Certainly ‘Nap and his Partner Joe’ is not one of Rowlandson’s
happiest efforts (September 29, 1808). Some
Dons are kicking the brothers into the gaping jaws of a
devil, singing meanwhile, ‘So seeing we were finely nick’d.
Plump to the Devil we boldly kick’d. Both <i>Nap</i> and his
Partner <i>Joe</i>.’</p>

carousing. Napoleon is rising and giving a toast. ‘Come,

  <div class="caption">APOLLYON, THE DEVIL’S GENERALISSIMO, ADDRESSING HIS
LEGIONS.</div></div>

<p>‘Apollyon, the Devil’s Generalissimo, addressing his
legions,’ a portion of which is here reproduced, is by
I. Cruikshank (October 7, 1808). His speech is as follows:
‘Legions of Death. After having ravished, murdered, and
plundered, on the banks of the Danube, and the Vistula, I
shall order you to march through France, without allowing
you a moment’s rest!! I have occasion for you&mdash;the
hideous presence of <i>Religion</i>, and <i>Loyalty</i>, contaminates
the Continent of Spain, and Portugal. Let your <i>aspect</i>
drive them away from thence; let us carry our conquering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Eagles to the gates of Heaven: <i>there also we have an
injury to avenge</i>&mdash;you have exceeded all modern murderers&mdash;you
have placed yourselves on a level with the
most <i>ferocious cannibals</i>&mdash;Eternal War, Robbery, and
Plunder shall be the reward of your Exertions, for I
never can enjoy rest till the Sea is covered with your
Blood!!’ And the army rejoice, shouting: ‘Ha, Ha, more
Blood!’</p>

<p>A rather clever broadside, artist unknown (October
1808), shows us ‘General Nap turned Methodist Preacher.’
Napoleon, in a black gown, occupies the pulpit, having in
his hand a musket with fixed bayonet, on which is a windmill,
and, in his wig, he has fixed a cross, tricoloured flag,
surmounted by a cap of liberty, and a crescent. In the
vestry hang a military uniform, an episcopal mitre, and
chasuble, or cope&mdash;a Turkish costume, a bottle of arsenic
for the poor sick of Jaffa, a musket labelled ‘Scarecrow,’
and a bloody dagger, which does duty as the ‘Imperial
Cross.’ A general acts as clerk, the organ pipes are
cannon, and the audience, when not military, is seated
on drums. The letterpress is as follows: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>‘General Nap
turned Methodist Preacher, a new attempt to gull the
credulous; dedicated to Mr. Whitbread. “<i>Dear Sam,
repeat my Words, but not my Actions.</i>” “Dearly beloved
brethren, Honour, Country, liberty! this is the order of the
day; far from us all idea of conquest, bloodshed, and war.
Religion and true Philosophy must ever be our maxim.
Liberty, a free Constitution, and no Taxes, that is our cry.
No Slave trade; humanity shudders at the very thought
of it!! The brave, the excellent, English detest it. Yea,
we shall all be happy. Commerce, Plenty, and all sorts of
pretty things will be our lot. Good Jacobins, rise and
assert your rights. And you, brave soldiers, the honour of
France, Plunder and Blood shall once more be your cry.
Double pay and cities burnt will come down in showers
upon you. Yea! ye shall all be Generals, all be members
of the Legion of Honour! The Eagles will once more
cover the world. Now is the time to destroy Great Britain,
that treacherous country which always seeks our ruin.
Honour and Victory will lead us.</p>

<p>‘“Dear Countrymen, without good faith there is no tie
in this world. Dear Jacobins, we all acknowledge no God,
and nothing else. Let the Altars be lighted up, and your
organs play the Marseillois, that sacred air, which fires
every Frenchman’s breast. Yea, I swear by this holy
Cross I now hold in my hands, and in this sacred place,
that you are all free, and without restraint, that my intentions
are pure, and that I wish for nothing else but Peace,
Plunder, and Liberty! Amen!!”’</p>

<p>‘Political Quacks, or the Erfurt Co-partnership commencing
Business’ (artist unknown, November 1808) shows
Napoleon, as a quack doctor, on a stage with a muzzled
bear (Russia), who is distributing handbills, and says:
‘Ladies and Gentlemen, I am proud to say, as well as my
muzzle will permit me, that I have a large share in the
concern.’ Seated behind Napoleon are his different
patients, whilst Death, grinning through a curtain, calls
out: ‘Walk up, walk up, kill or cure.’ Napoleon himself,
as the quack doctor, has in his hand one of his famous
cannon-ball pills, one of which ‘is a dose,’ and a trayful of
them is on the floor of the stage. They are named Naples,
Egypt, Lodi, Alps, Switzerland, &amp;c.; and he declaims:
‘Ladies and Gentlemen, depend upon it here is no deception.
Observe the patients ranged behind me. On my
right, a Prussian Gentleman, who was much afflicted with a
complication of disorders, till I cured him by administering
a few leaden Boluses&mdash;next to him is an Austrian patient,
entirely reliev’d by my Austerlitz draught, next to him is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Spaniard, whose case is rather doubtful&mdash;I won’t say much
about it. The next is a Dutchman&mdash;he was a little crack’d,
but I have made him as lame as a frog&mdash;beyond him is an
old gentleman of the Popish persuasion, whom I cured
with one bottle of my Italian drops&mdash;there are many more
in the background, whom I have cured of various disorders,
or have now in my care&mdash;but, Ladies and Gentlemen, let
me particularly draw your attention to the great Russian
bear, once a very fierce animal, but dumb like the rest of
his species, but after taking a dose of my Friedland Pills,
and an application of the Tilsit powder, he is able to converse
like a rational being!!!’ Talleyrand, who is on the
stage, calls out: ‘Ah, Master Bull, what, are you among
the crowd? come now, you and your Sweedish Friend
had better step up into the Booth, and take a dose or
two of my Master’s pills.’ But John Bull surlily declines
the invitation with, ‘We’ll see you and your Master d&mdash;d
first.’</p>

<p>This of course refers to the meeting of Napoleon and
Alexander at Erfurt, where, besides, were collected the
Kings of Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria, Würtemberg, and
Westphalia, the Prince Primate, the Princes of Anhalt,
Coburg, Saxe Weimar, Darmstadt, Baden, Nassau, and
Mecklenburg. The two great potentates rivalled each
other in their courtesies. But solid business was also to
be done; they did not meet simply to waste their time in
fêtes. Napoleon engaged not to meddle with Alexander’s
designs on Sweden and Turkey, and not to help the Poles.
Alexander, on his side, promised not to interfere in Spain,
and to recognise the Kings of Spain and Naples. And
they wrote a joint letter to George the Third, proposing a
general peace, on the basis that each should keep what he
had. The English Government, however, asked that Spain
and Sweden should be parties; but this, not suiting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
designs of the Imperial thieves, the negotiations came to
an end.</p>

<p>An unknown artist (November 19, 1808) gives ‘The
Progress of the Emperor Napoleon.’ At first he is represented
as ‘A Ragged Headed Corsican Peasant’; next,
‘Studying mischief at the Royal Academy at Paris’; then
‘An Humble Ensign in a Republican Corps requesting a
situation in the British Army’; afterwards, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>‘A determined
Atheistical Republican General, ordering his men to fire on
the Parisians vollies of grape shot.’ He then changes to ‘A
Turk at Grand Cairo’; afterwards he became ‘A runaway
from Egypt’; then ‘A devout Catholic,’ and, finally, ‘An
Emperor on a throne of iniquities’: on which throne is inscribed,
‘Murders&mdash;Duke d’Enghien, Prisoners at Jaffa,
Palm, Capt. Williams, Pichegru, Cahon, Toussaint, &amp;c., &amp;c.
Robberies innumerable.’</p>

<span class="subhead">RETREAT TO CORUNNA&mdash;THE BROKEN BRIDGE OVER THE DANUBE&mdash;WAGRAM&mdash;JOSEPHINE’S
DIVORCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the year 1809 there are very few caricatures of Napoleon.
After the taking of Madrid, Sir John Moore thought it
prudent to retreat, which he did, and, after many difficulties,
reached Corunna. The repulse of the French there, although
at the cost of Sir John Moore’s life, enabled the troops to
be embarked.</p>

<p>Napoleon had but little rest, for in March the Austrians
again took up arms against him, to which he replied by
victoriously marching to Vienna, which was bombarded
before it capitulated. One incident in this campaign was
seized upon by the caricaturist. There had been much
fighting about Aspern and Essling, with pretty equal fortune,
until the destruction of a bridge, caused by a sudden
rise of the Danube, which brought down timber rafts, barges,
&amp;c., deprived Napoleon of all the advantage he had gained,
and compelled him to retreat to the island of Lobau.</p>

<p>There is a caricature by Rowlandson (June 12, 1809) of
‘Boney’s Broken Bridge.’ An aged general, cocked-hat in
hand, is thus addressing Napoleon: ‘With all due deference
to your little Majesty&mdash;It was the Austrian Fire-boats that
destroyed the Bridge.’ Napoleon, however, turns on him
savagely, and, pointing to the broken bridge, says, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>‘Ah!
who is it that dares contradict me, I say it was some floating
timber, and the high swell of the river that caused the
Shocking Accident.’ The Austrian army, on the opposite
bank, are singing a paraphrase of ‘London bridge is broken
<span class="locked">down’:&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Ansell gives his version of this event, shewing the Austrian
Archduke, pickaxe in hand, having destroyed the
bridge, and, pointing to some ducks and geese, he <span class="locked">sings:&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="i18">Fal de rol de rido, Fal de rol de rido.<br /></span>

<p class="in0">But Napoleon, dancing with rage, on the other side,
yells out, ‘You Rascal you! How dare you break down
my Bridge, If I knew how to get over, this invincible arm
should make you repent your rashness.’ In the background
an officer calls out to the army, ‘Invincible Army go back,
the bridge is broke down and we should not be able to run
away.’</p>

<p>It was in this retreat that Lannes was killed&mdash;but it
was avenged at Wagram, a battle that so crippled the
Austrians that they had to ask an armistice, which afterwards
led to a peace between the rival nations.</p>

<p>Sauler (August 1809) shews us ‘The rising Sun, or a view
of the Continent.’ This rising sun is inscribed ‘Spain and
Portugal,’ and gives great uneasiness to Napoleon, who
says, ‘The rising sun has set me upon thorns.’ He is employed
in rocking a cradle, in which peacefully reposes a
Russian bear, muzzled with ‘Boney’s Promises.’ Behind
is Sweden, who brandishes his sword, calling to Russia to
‘Awake thou Sluggard, ere the fatal blow is struck, and
thou and thy execrable ally sink into eternal oblivion.’
Holland is fast asleep, and leans against Napoleon. Poland
is represented by a shadow, and Denmark wears a huge
extinguisher on his head. Turkey is virtually dead, on
the ground; but Austria is springing into activity, exclaiming,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
‘Tyrant, I defy thee and thy Cursed Crew.’
Prussia is depicted as a lunatic, with straws in his hair,
wearing a strait-waistcoat, and, with a very vacuous expression
of countenance, is singing, ‘Fiddle diddle dee,
Fiddle diddle dee, The Mouse has married the humble bee&mdash;and

<p>One of the great events of this year, as regards Napoleon,
was his divorce from Josephine. That he loved her, as far
as he could love any woman, there is no doubt; but there
were State reasons why he should have another consort.
His ambition could not be satisfied till he had an heir male
of his own. The dynasty he fondly hoped to found ought
not to descend to any of his brothers; and none but his own
son could have any hold upon the affection of the French
nation.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>How Josephine herself felt on this subject is pathetically
told by Madame Junot, with an excessively womanly
<span class="locked">grace:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘I had an interview with the Empress at Malmaison:
I went thither to breakfast by invitation, accompanied by
my eldest daughter Josephine, to whom she was much attached....
“And Madame Mère, have you seen her since
your return?” “Certainly, Madame, I have already been in
waiting.” Upon this, the Empress drew closer to me&mdash;she
was already very near&mdash;and, taking both my hands, said, in
a tone of grief which is still present to my mind after an
interval of four-and-twenty years: “Madame Junot, I entreat
you to tell me all you have heard relating to me. I
ask it as an especial favour&mdash;you know they all desire to
ruin me, my Hortense, and my Eugène. Madame Junot,
I again entreat, as a favour, that you will tell me all you
know!”</p>

<p>‘She spoke with the greatest anxiety; her lips trembled,
and her hands were damp and cold. In point of fact she
was right, for there could be no more direct means of
knowing what was passing, relative to her, than by learning
what was said in the house of Madame Mère. But it was
indiscreet, perhaps, to ask these questions of me. In the
first place, I should not have repeated the most insignificant
sentence which I had heard in Madame’s drawing-room;
in the second, I was quite at ease upon the subject; for,
since my return, I had not heard the word <i>divorce</i> uttered
by Madame, or the princesses. The strength of mind of
the unfortunate wife failed totally on hearing the dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
word pronounced; she leant upon my arm and wept
bitterly. “Madame Junot,” she said, “remember what I say
to you this day, here, in this hothouse&mdash;this place which is
now a paradise, but which may soon become a desert to me&mdash;remember
that this separation will be my death, and it
is they who have killed me?”</p>

<p>‘She sobbed. My little Josephine, running to her, pulled
her by the shawl to shew her some flowers she had plucked,
for the Empress was so fond of her, as even to permit her
to gather flowers in her greenhouse. She took her in her
arms, and pressed her to her bosom, with an almost convulsive
emotion. The child appeared frightened; but,
presently, raising her head, and shaking the forest of light
silken curls which clustered round her face, she fixed her
large blue eyes upon the agitated countenance of her godmother,
and said: “I do not like you to cry.” The Empress
again embraced her tenderly, and setting her down,
said to me: “You can have little idea how much I have
suffered when any of you has brought a child to me!
Heaven knows, I am not envious, but in this one case I
have felt as if a deadly poison were creeping through my
veins, when I have looked upon the fresh and rosy cheek
of a beautiful child, the joy of its mother, but, above all,
the hope of its father! And I! struck with barrenness,
shall be driven in disgrace from the bed of him who has
given me a crown! Yet God is witness that I love him
more than my life, and much more than that throne, that
crown, which he has given me!”</p>

<p>‘The Empress may have appeared more beautiful, but
never more attractive, than at that moment. If Napoleon
had seen her then, surely he could never have divorced
her.’</p>

<p>We have a most touching account in ‘Memes’s Memoirs
of the Empress Josephine:’ <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>‘The divorce was, unquestionably,
a melancholy reverse of fortune for Josephine, which
she felt most severely, but she bore it with magnanimity.
The particulars of the interview between her and the
Emperor are very affecting. When Napoleon mentioned
the necessity of a Divorce, he approached Josephine, gazed
on her for a while, and then pronounced the following
words: “Josephine, my excellent Josephine, thou knowest
if I have loved thee! To thee, to thee alone do I owe the
only moments of happiness which I have enjoyed in this
world. Josephine! my destiny overmasters my will. My
dearest affections must be silent before the interests of
France.” “Say no more,” she replied, “I was prepared for
this; but the blow is not less mortal!”</p>

<p>‘Josephine, on hearing from his own lips the determination
of the Emperor, fainted, and was carried to her
chamber. At length the fatal day arrived.</p>

<p>‘On December 15, 1809, the Imperial Council of State
was convened, and, for the first time, officially informed of
the intended separation. On the morrow, the whole of the
family assembled in the grand salon at the Tuileries. All
were in Court costume. Napoleon’s was the only countenance
which betrayed emotion, but ill concealed by the
drooping plumes of his hat of ceremony. He stood
motionless as a statue, his arms crossed upon his breast:
the members of his family were seated around, showing in
their expression less of sympathy with so painful a scene,
than of satisfaction, that one was to be removed, who had
so long held influence, gently exerted as it had been, over
their brother. In the centre of the apartment was placed
an armchair, and, before it, a small table with a writing
apparatus of gold. All eyes were directed to that spot,
when a door opened, and Josephine, pale but calm
appeared, leaning on the arm of her daughter, whose fast
falling tears shewed that she had not attained the resignation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
of her mother. Both were dressed in the simplest
manner. Josephine’s dress of white muslin exhibited
not a single ornament. She moved slowly, and with
wonted grace, to the seat provided for her, and there
listened to the reading of the act of separation. Behind
her chair stood Hortense, whose sobs were audible, and
a little farther on, towards Napoleon, Eugène, trembling
as if incapable of supporting himself. Josephine heard in
composure the words that placed an eternal barrier between
her and greatness, between her and the object of her affection.
This painful duty over, the Empress appeared to acquire
a degree of resolution from the very effort to resign with
dignity the realities of title for ever. Pressing, for an
instant, the handkerchief to her eyes, she rose, and, with a
voice which, but for a slight tremor, might have been
called firm, pronounced the oath of acceptance; then,
sitting down, she took the pen from the hand of the Comte
Regnault St. Jean d’Angely, and signed it. The mother
and daughter now left the salon, followed by Eugène, who
appeared to suffer most severely of the three.</p>

<p>‘The sad incidents of the day had not yet been exhausted.
Josephine had remained unseen, sorrowing in
her chamber, till Napoleon’s usual hour of retiring to rest.
He had just placed himself in bed, silent and melancholy,
when suddenly the private door opened, and the Empress
appeared, her hair in disorder, and her face swollen with
weeping. Advancing with a tottering step, she stood, as if
irresolute, near the bed, clasped her hands, and burst into
an agony of tears. Delicacy seemed at first to have
arrested her progress, but, forgetting everything in the fulness
of her grief, she threw herself on the bed, clasped her
husband’s neck, and sobbed as if her heart would break.
Napoleon also wept while he endeavoured to console her,
and they remained a few minutes locked in each other’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
arms, silently mingling their tears, until the Emperor,
perceiving Constant<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> in the room, dismissed him to the
ante-chamber.</p>

<p>‘After an interview of about an hour, Josephine parted,
for ever, from the man whom she so long and so tenderly
loved. On seeing the Empress retire, which she did in
tears, the attendant entered to remove the lights, and found
the chamber silent as death, and Napoleon sunk among
the bed-clothes, so as to be invisible. Next morning he
still showed the marks of suffering. At eleven, Josephine
was to bid adieu to the Tuileries, never to enter the palace
more. The whole household assembled on the stairs, in
order to obtain a last look of a mistress whom they loved,
and who carried with her into exile the hearts of all who
had enjoyed the happiness of access to her presence.
Josephine was veiled from head to foot, and, entering a
close carriage with six horses, drove rapidly away, without
casting one look backward on the scene of past greatness
and departed happiness.’</p>

<p>The only drawback to Memes’s narrative is, that it does
not exactly tally with the ‘Register of the Conservative
Senate,’ of Saturday, December 6, 1809, extracts from which
are given in the ‘Times’ of December 27, 1809. In that
document Napoleon makes a speech, a portion of which is
as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘The politics of my monarchy, the interest, and the
wants, of my people, which have constantly guided all my
actions, require that, after me, I should leave to children,
inheritors of my love for my people, that throne on which
Providence has placed me. Notwithstanding, for several
years past, I have lost the hope of having children by my
well-beloved consort, the Empress Josephine. This it is
which induces me to sacrifice the sweetest affections of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
heart; to attend to nothing but the good of the State, and
to wish the dissolution of my marriage.</p>

<p>‘Arrived at the age of forty years, I may indulge the
hope of living long enough to educate, in my views and
sentiments, the children which it may please Providence to
give me: God knows how much such a resolution has cost
my heart; but there is no sacrifice beyond my courage,
that I will not make, when it is proved to me to be necessary
to the welfare of France. I should add, that far from
ever having had reason to complain, I have only had to be
satisfied with the attachment and affection of my well-beloved
consort. She has adorned fifteen years of my life,
the remembrance of which will ever remain engraven on
my heart. She was crowned by my hand. I wish she
should preserve the rank and title of Empress; but, above
all, that she should never doubt my sentiments, and that
she should ever regard me as her best and dearest friend.’</p>

<p>English opinion on this act of Napoleon’s may be
gathered from the ‘Times’ of December 28, which thus
comments upon <span class="locked">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘While the affair of the dissolution of Buonaparte’s
marriage was transacting in the Senate, he retired to
Trianon. The repudiated Josephine withdrew, at the same
time, to Malmaison, probably never to behold him again;
or, at most, only for a few minutes, during a visit of cold
ceremony. Whatever errors there might have been in the
early conduct of this woman, were in a great measure redeemed
by her behaviour during her slippery, and precarious,
exaltation. She has often stepped in between the rage of
the tyrant to whom she was united, and the victim he had
marked for destruction, and by her tears, and entreaties,
softened him into pity and pardon. Such instances of
feeling, and humanity, had wrought a powerful impression
in her favour among the inhabitants of Paris, amongst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
whom, her unmerited disgrace has probably occasioned no
less grief than astonishment. The temporary seclusion to
which Buonaparte appears to have condemned himself,
may possibly be for the purpose of preventing any opportunity
of an explosion of public sentiment on this subject.
We think, on the whole, that Josephine has been hardly
treated. The reasons assigned for her repudiation have
existed in equal force for many years; and the act itself
might have been carried into effect, with less outrage to her
feelings, at a former period.’</p>

WOOING OF, AND MARRIAGE WITH, MARIA LOUISA&mdash;BIRTH
OF THE KING OF ROME&mdash;NAPOLEON IN THE NURSERY.</p></blockquote>

<p>In closing the record of this year, I cannot omit to mention
the fact of the failures of the expeditions to Spain,
Portugal, and Holland. The latter, or Walcheren expedition,
as it was called, was just returning in a woful plight,
fever having thoroughly done its work among the troops;
and, in December, the City of London, through the Lord
Mayor, memorialised the King on the subject of this latter
expedition, and prayed ‘your Majesty will direct enquiry to
be forthwith instituted, in order to ascertain the causes
which have occasioned it.’</p>

<p>‘To which Address and Petition his Majesty was
graciously pleased to return the following <span class="locked">answer:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘“I thank you for your expressions of duty and attachment

several objects of great importance in the interest of my

good.”’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
This was the Royal, or Ministerial, snubbing to those
men who were then giving of their blood, and treasure,
without stint, and without grumble.</p>

<p>The ‘Times’ of December 21, 1809, is very wroth about
it, and the sturdy citizens answered it by having a Common
Hall on January 9, 1810, at which it was resolved that
instructions be given to the representatives of the City, to
move or support an address to his Majesty, praying an
inquiry into the cause of the failures of the late expeditions
to Spain, Portugal, and Holland; they also voted a similar
address themselves; and asserted a right to deliver their
addresses or petitions to the King upon his throne. But
they got no redress.</p>

<p>The year 1810 is mostly noteworthy to the caricaturist
by Napoleon’s second marriage. On February 1, 1810, a
grand council was called together to help the Emperor in
selecting another empress. But Napoleon had not been
wasting his time since his divorce from Josephine. He
had sent to the Emperor Alexander, proposing to marry
his sister, the Grand Duchess Anna Paulovna; but the
Russian Emperor, although he professed great friendship
for Napoleon, hardly cared about a closer alliance with
him, and the proposal was declined.</p>

<p>The Council, in their wisdom, thought of an Austrian
princess, and a proposal was made to the Austrian ambassador
for the hand of the Arch-Duchess Maria Louisa,
the result of which should have been, if there is any truth
in the old rhyme,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Happy’s the wooing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That’s not long a-doing,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">the perfection of bliss to the principal parties concerned.
It was all settled in four-and-twenty hours, and Berthier,
as Napoleon’s proxy, married Maria Louisa at Vienna on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
March 11, and, two days afterwards, she started on her
journey to France.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Madame Junot for an insight into
her innocent and childlike character: ‘At length the day
of departure arrived. The young Empress bade farewell
to all the members of her family, and then retired to her
apartment, where etiquette required that she should wait
till Berthier came to conduct her to her carriage. When
Berthier entered the cabinet, he found her bathed in tears.
With a voice choked with sobs, she apologised for appearing
so childish: “But,” says she, “my grief is excusable.
See how I am surrounded here by a thousand things that
are dear to me. These are my sister’s drawings; that
tapestry was wrought by my mother; those paintings are
by my uncle Charles.” In this manner she went through
the inventory of her cabinet, and there was scarcely a
thing, down to the carpet on the floor, which was not the
work of some beloved hand.</p>

<p>‘There were her singing birds, her parrot, and, above all,
the object which she seemed to value most, and most to
regret&mdash;a little dog. It was of course known at the Court
of Vienna how greatly the Emperor used to be annoyed
by Josephine’s favourite pet dogs, with <i>Fortuné</i> at their
head. Therefore, Francis II., like a prudent father, took
care that his daughter should leave her pet dog at Vienna.
Yet it was a cruel separation, and the princess and her
favourite parted with a tender <i>duo</i> of complaint.’</p>

<p>But the surprises in store for her on her journey soon
made her forget her dog and parrot. She was met at
Braunau by Caroline Bonaparte, Queen of Naples, and
sister of the Emperor. At this place, on the frontier of
Austria and Bavaria (the latter of which was then part of
the French empire), a wooden building had been erected
for the use of the French and Austrian suites. Napoleon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
could play many parts, and he played the <i>rôle</i> of devoted
lover to perfection. At Munich an officer met the new
Empress with a letter from her husband. At Strasburg a
page was waiting for her with another letter, some choice
flowers, and some pheasants shot by the imperial gun;
and every morning brought a page with a letter, which the
young bride immediately answered.</p>

<p>Every detail of her progress had been settled with
rigid ceremonial, and at one place (Compiègne) it was
appointed that he was to meet her, when ‘the Empress
should prepare to kneel, and the Emperor should raise
her, embrace, and seat her beside him.’ But the imperial
bridegroom was far too impatient for that. Accompanied
by the King of Naples (Murat), he left the palace privately,
and pushed on to the village of Courcelles, where he
anxiously awaited her arrival. When the carriage stopped,
he ran towards it, opened the door himself, and jumped in
without any announcement, the bride being only advised
of his advent a moment before by the startled exclamation
of the Queen of Spain: ‘It is the Emperor!’</p>

<p>Two days afterwards they made their state entry into
Paris, where Napoleon, from a balcony at the Tuileries,
presented his young bride to the assembled multitude.</p>

<p>Once more to quote Madame Junot: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>‘On returning
from the balcony, he said to her, “Well, Louise, I must
give you some little reward for the happiness you have
conferred on me,” and, leading her into one of the narrow
corridors of the palace, lighted only by one lamp, he
hurried on with his beloved Empress, who exclaimed,
“Where are we going?”&mdash;“Come, Louise, are you afraid
to follow me?” replied the Emperor, who now pressed to
his bosom, with much affectionate tenderness, his young
bride.</p>

<p>‘Suddenly they stopped at a closed door, within which
they heard a dog that was endeavouring to escape from
the apparent prison. The Emperor opened this private
door, and desired Louise to enter. She found herself in a
room magnificently lighted; the glare of the lamps prevented
her for some moments from distinguishing any
object. Imagine her surprise when she found her favourite
dog from Vienna was there to greet her; the apartment
was furnished with the same chairs, carpet, the paintings
of her sisters, her birds&mdash;in short, every object was there,
and placed in the same manner as she had left them on
quitting her paternal roof.</p>

<p>‘The Empress, in joy and gratitude, threw herself in
Napoleon’s arms, and the moment of a great victory would
not have been to the conqueror of the world so sweet as this
instant of ecstasy was to the infatuated heart of the adoring
bridegroom. After a few minutes had been spent in examining
the apartment, the Emperor opened a small door;
he beckoned to Berthier, who entered. Napoleon then
said, “Louise, it is to him you are indebted for this unexpected
joy: I desire you will embrace him, as a just
recompense.” Berthier took the hand of the Empress;
but the Emperor added, “No, no, you must kiss my old
and faithful friend.”’</p>

<p>The civil marriage was celebrated on April 1 at St.
Cloud, and the religious marriage on the 2nd in the
Chapel of the Louvre; Napoleon’s uncle, Cardinal Fesch,
officiating.</p>

<p>We have just read the real story of the wooing and
home-coming; I will not spoil it by repeating the caricaturist’s
version, quoting only a few <span class="locked">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="caption">FIRST INTERVIEW WITH MARIA LOUISA.</div></div>

<p>This year is so unproductive of Napoleonic caricatures,
that I can only find one worth mentioning, and this is
apropos of the marriage: it is called ‘Three Weeks after
Marriage, or the Great little Emperor playing at Bo-peep,’
and is by Rowlandson (May 15, 1810). It shows the conjugal
relations of Napoleon and his Empress, as they were
supposed to be. She is in a violent rage, and, having
knocked down Talleyrand, she hits him over the head with
a sceptre; he, meanwhile, making moan: ‘Begar she will
give us all de finishing stroke. I shall never rise again.’
She has plucked off her crown, and is about to throw it at
the Emperor, who dodges behind an armchair, calling out,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
‘Oh Tally, Tally, rise and rally.’ She fiercely declaims,
‘By the head of Jove, I hate him worse than Famine or
Disease. Perish his Family; let inveterate Hate commence
between our Houses from this Moment, and, meeting,
never let them bloodless part.’ Somebody, probably
one of the marshals, has got behind the curtains for safety,
calling out, ‘Marblue. Vat a <i>Crown Cracker</i> she be.’</p>

<p>At the time of the marriage the English newspapers
were much taken up with Sir Francis Burdett, and consequently
Napoleon’s marriage did not receive the attention
it otherwise might have claimed. In a notice of the religious
ceremony, however, the ‘Times’ breaks out with a
little bit of spite, ‘The Imperial Ruffian, and his spouse,
again knelt at the “<i>Ite, missa est</i>.”’</p>

<p>The only other great event during this year, connected
with Napoleon, was the abdication of the crown of Holland
by his brother Louis, and the absorption of his kingdom
into the French empire.</p>

<p>The birth of the King of Rome (on March 20, 1811)
at last gave Napoleon the hope of founding a dynasty.
He was very anxious about the welfare of Maria Louisa,
hardly bestowing a thought upon his son, until assured of
her safety.</p>

<p>‘As<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> soon as the King of Rome was born, the event
was announced by telegraph to all the principal towns of
the empire. At four o’clock the same afternoon, the marks
of rejoicing in the provinces equalled those in Paris. The
Emperor’s couriers, pages, and officers, were despatched to
the different foreign Courts, with intelligence of the happy
event. The Senate of Italy, and the municipal bodies of
Rome and Milan, had immediate notice of it. The different
fortresses received orders to fire salutes; the seaports
were enlivened by the display of colours from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
vessels; and everywhere the people voluntarily illuminated
their houses. Those who regard these popular demonstrations
as expressions of the secret sentiments of a people
might have remarked that in all the faubourgs, as well as
the lowest and poorest quarters of Paris, the houses were
illuminated to the very uttermost stories. A fête was got
up on the occasion by the watermen of the Seine, which
was prolonged until a late hour of the night. Much of all
this was not ordered: it came spontaneously from the
hearts of the people. That same people, who, for thirty-five
years previously, had experienced so many emotions,
had wept over so many reverses, and had rejoiced for so
many victories, still showed, by their enthusiasm on this
occasion, that they retained affections as warm and vivid
as in the morning of their greatness.</p>

<p>‘The King of Rome was baptized on the very day of
his birth (March 20, 1811). The ceremony was performed,
at nine in the evening, in the chapel of the Tuileries. The
whole of the imperial family attended, and the Emperor
witnessed the ceremony with the deepest emotion. Napoleon
proceeded to the chapel, followed by the members of
the household, those of the Empress, of Madame Mère, the
princesses, his sisters, and of the kings, his brothers. He
took his station under a canopy in the centre of the chapel,
having before him a stool to kneel on. A socle of granite
had been placed on a carpet of white velvet embroidered
with gold bees, and on the socle stood a gold vase destined
for the baptismal font. When the Emperor approached
the font bearing the King of Rome in his arms, the most
profound silence pervaded. It was a religious silence,
unaccompanied by the parade which might have been
expected on such an occasion. This stillness formed a
striking contrast with the joyous acclamations of the people
outside.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
The news was announced to the British public in the
‘Times’ of March 25; and in the ‘Morning Herald’ of
March 26 is an amusing</p>

<p>Rowlandson caricatures the birth of the King of Rome
(April 9, 1811) in ‘Boney the Second, or the little Babboon
created to devour French Monkies.’ The young Napoleon,
naked, with the exception of a cocked hat, but with the
cloven hoofs, and tail, of a devil, is being presented on a
cushion to his father by a very buxom nurse. The cushion
rests on a cradle, on which is inscribed ‘Devil’s Darling.’
Napoleon is looking after the nursery arrangements, and is
cooking a caudle of ‘French blood,’ which is to be drunk
out of a ‘Bitter Cup.’ He turns his face towards his little
son, and exclaims: ‘Rejoice O ye Frenchmen, the Fruits
of my Labour has produced a little image of myself.
I shall, for the love I owe to your country, instill in my
Noble Offspring the same principles of Lying, Thieving,
Treachery, Letchery, Murder, and all other foul deeds for
which I am now worshipped and adored.’ The Pope is on
his knees pronouncing a benediction, which, however, is of
rather doubtful character.</p>

<p>Madame Junot gives some interesting details of Napoleon
as a father:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>‘On my return to France, I found
the Emperor much altered in appearance. His features
had acquired a paternal character. What a beautiful
child was the young King of Rome! How lovely he
appeared as he rode through the gardens of the Tuileries
in his shell-shaped <i>calèche</i>, drawn by two young deer,
which had been trained by Franconi, and which were
given him by his aunt, the Queen of Naples. He resembled
one of those figures of Cupid which have been discovered
in the ruins of Herculaneum. One day I had been visiting
the young King, the Emperor was also there, and he was
playing with the child&mdash;as he always played with those he
loved&mdash;that is to say, he was tormenting him. The Emperor
had been riding, and held in his hand a whip, which
attracted the child’s notice. He stretched out his little
hand, and when he seized the whip, burst into a fit of
laughter, at the same time embracing his father. “Is he
not a fine boy, Madame Junot?” said the Emperor; “you
must confess that he is.” I could say so without flattery,
for he certainly was a lovely boy. “You were not at
Paris,” continued the Emperor, “when my son was born.
It was on that day I learned how much the Parisians love
me.... What did the army say on the birth of the
child?” I told him the soldiers were enthusiastic during
many days; he had already heard so, but was happy to
receive a confirmation of their joy. He then pinched his
son’s cheek and his nose; the child cried. “Come, come,
sir,” said the Emperor, “do you suppose you are never to
be thwarted, and do kings cry?”... He used to take the
King of Rome in his arms, and toss him up in the air.
The child would then laugh, until the tears stood in his
eyes. Sometimes the Emperor would take him before a
looking-glass, and work his face into all sorts of grimaces;
and, if the child was frightened and shed tears, Napoleon
would say: “What, Sire, do you cry? A King, and cry?
Shame, Shame!”</p>

<p>‘The hours at which the young King was taken to the
Emperor were not precisely fixed, nor could they be, but his
visits were most frequently at the time of <i>déjeûner</i>. On
these occasions the Emperor would give the child a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
claret, by dipping his finger in the glass, and making him
suck it. Sometimes he would daub the young Prince’s
face with gravy. The child would laugh heartily at seeing
his father as much a child as he was himself, and only
loved him the more for it. Children invariably love those
who play with them. I recollect that once when Napoleon
had daubed the young King’s face, the child was highly
amused, and asked the Emperor to do the same to <i>Maman
Quiou</i>, for so he called his governess, Madame de Montesquiou.’</p>

<p>Rowlandson’s idea of the royal infant is given in a
caricature (published April 14, 1811) called, ‘Nursing the
Spawn of a Tyrant, or Frenchmen Sick of the Brood.’<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
Maria Louisa is aghast at her offspring, who, screaming,
threatens her with a dagger. She thus pours out her woes:
‘There’s no condition sure, so curst as mine! Day and
night to dandle such a dragon&mdash;the little angry cur snarls
while it feeds; see how the blood is settled in its scarecrow
face; what brutal mischief sits upon his brow. Rage and
vengeance sparkle in his cheeks; the very spawn and spit
of its tyrant father. Nay, now I look again, he is the very
picture of his grandfather, <i>the Devil</i>!’ This must have
been pleasant for Napoleon to hear, which he evidently
does, as he is but partially concealed behind a curtain.</p>

<p>Some one (name unknown, August 20, 1811) has given
us, ‘The Deputeys apointed by the Legislative Body, doing
Homage to the King of Rome in the Nursery at St.
Cloud.’ His <i>gouvernante</i>, Madame de Montesquiou, presents
him to the Deputies, who kneel and kiss him, saying:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>‘Madam Governess&mdash;not one of us can behold without a
most lively interest, that August Infant&mdash;on whom rest so
many Destinies, and whose Age and Charming Qualities
inspire the most tender sentiments in the French and surrounding
Nations.’ The lady replies: ‘Monsieurs&mdash;I
thank you for the polite and flattering encomiums you are
pleased to bestow on me&mdash;I thank you in the name of the
young prince, whose Charms are inexpressible, and regret
that he cannot add his personal sentiments to those which
I entertain, to the Legislative Body.’ In another portion
of the picture the foul linen of the precious child is being
washed and hung to dry.</p>

<p>The next caricature requires some little explanation. We
find in the ‘Courier’ of September 20, 1811, the following
paragraph:&mdash;‘Dover, September 19. Early this morning
we heard a heavy firing on the opposite shore; it continued
at times all the morning, and was very hot about one
o’clock; the wind is to the southward, and eastward,
which makes us hear very plain; no news has arrived as
to the cause; by some it is conjectured that Buonaparte is
at Boulogne, and by others, that the flotilla is out, and
some of our cruisers firing at them. It still continues,
though not so heavy as in the early part of the day.’</p>

<p>Details did not arrive till the 22nd, and then the
‘Courier’ published an account of the naval engagement off
Boulogne, on which the caricature is evidently grounded:
‘The cause of the incessant firing on the French Coast, is
now ascertained to be an engagement between the <i>Naiad</i>,
3 sloops, and a cutter, and 7 large French praams, each as
large as a frigate, 11 gun brigs, and other small craft, 27
in all. The following letter gives an account of the engagement:&mdash;We
took the Port Admiral in his praam, but
afterwards ran off&mdash;However we took another, and brought
her away&mdash;Buonaparte saw the engagement&mdash;he was in a
boat with Marshall Ney.’</p>

<p>All accounts, though they do not agree in the number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
of French vessels engaged, are singularly unanimous as to
the presence of Napoleon and Ney.</p>

<p>‘The first glorious exploit of the Invincible Flotilla.
Devils among the Flats, or Boney getting into Hot Water’
(unknown artist, September 20, 1811), represents one of
the Flotilla returning much damaged, and full of corpses,
only the captain and a steersman alive on board. Napoleon,
who is in another boat, is in a fearful rage, tries to get
at him, and is restrained by one of his marshals (Ney)&mdash;who
remarks, ‘Ma foi, take care, your Majesty will be in
hot water up to the chin’&mdash;from throwing himself into the
boiling water. ‘You scoundrel,’ says he, ‘how dare you
run away when you were 27 to 5. I’ll order the guns of
the batteries to sink every one of you.’ But the captain
excuses himself, ‘Eh bien, mais, mon Empereur, you tell
us de Jack Anglais be men, mais, by Gar, we find dem
Devils.’ To which a man in Napoleon’s boat replies,
‘Very true Monsieur Ney, de devils Jack Bulls make hot
water all over de Vorld.’ The spirit of Nelson appears,
like a comet in the sky, darting lightning at the Flotilla.</p>

<p>The year 1812 was not fruitful in caricature of Napoleon.
In May, accompanied by Maria Louisa, he visited
the eastern part of France, met the King and Queen of
Saxony at Freyburg, and entered Dresden in state. There
he met the Emperor and Empress of Austria, the King of
Prussia, and the Kings of Saxony, Naples, Würtemberg,
Westphalia, and Bavaria, besides a heap of smaller potentates.
The Emperor of Russia was not present; he had
concluded an alliance with Sweden against France, an alliance
which was afterwards, during this year, joined by Great
Britain. In June, Napoleon visited Dantzig, and left it on
the 11th. As a final measure, Count Lauriston was sent
to Alexander, to see if the difference could be patched up,
but the breach was made inevitable by the refusal of that
monarch, or his ministers, to see him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
This decided Napoleon, and, from his head-quarters
at Wilkowisky, he issued the following proclamation:
‘Soldiers! the second war of Poland has commenced.
The first was terminated at Friedland and Tilsit. At
Tilsit, Russia swore eternal alliance with France, and war
against England. She has openly violated her oath; and
refuses to render any explanation of her strange conduct,
till the French eagles shall have repassed the Rhine, and,
consequently, left their Allies at her discretion. Russia is
impelled onward by fatality. Her destiny is about to be
accomplished. Does she believe that we have degenerated?
that we are no longer the soldiers of Austerlitz? She has
placed us between dishonour and war: the choice cannot
for a moment be doubtful. Let us march forward then,
and, crossing the Niemen, carry the war into her territories!
The second war of Poland will be to the French
arms as glorious as the first; but our next peace must
carry with it its own guarantee, and put an end to that
arrogant influence which, for the last fifty years, Russia
has exercised over the affairs of Europe.’</p>

<p>In No. 1 of a series of caricatures on the Russian campaign,
published in April 1813, and seemingly by G.
Cruikshank, is represented, ‘The Parting of Hector-Nap,
and Andromache, or Russia threatened.’ Napoleon’s horse
is waiting for him, the windows are crowded with ladies to
see the departure. Napoleon is ecstatic at the sight of his
little son, who is held aloft by Maria Louisa. The young
King of Rome flourishes a sword, and says, ‘I will kill the
people, as my Papa does.’ His mother wishes him to
‘Kiss him, then, my dear! and he will bring you some of
the naughty Russians to kill.’ Napoleon bids ‘Farewell!
I go, I’ll see, I’ll conquer. On my return I’ll greet our
Son with a new Title.</p>

</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Napoleon started on this disastrous campaign, which
was the prelude to his downfall, with an army of about
four hundred and twenty thousand men, most of them
doomed to perish in the snows of Russia. The river
Niemen was crossed, and, on June 28, Napoleon made his
public entry into Wilna, which had not long since, and very
hurriedly, been evacuated by the Emperor Alexander.</p>

<p>But even the commencement of this campaign was
marked by disaster. Napoleon had arranged all the details;
but the incompetence, or worse, of his subordinates
failed to carry them out. After the Niemen had been
crossed, not a third of the provisions necessary for the
army had arrived, and at Wilna it was found that some
hundreds of men had perished from want and fatigue.
The mortality was worse among the horses, having lost
about ten thousand. Before a battle was fought, and
scarcely a month from the commencement of the campaign,
there were twenty-five thousand sick men in the
hospitals at Wilna.</p>

<p>Napoleon waited a fortnight at Wilna; but the Russians
were driven back from Ostrovno, by Murat, and
more time was consumed at Witepsk. Then came the
attack on Smolensko, on August 16 and 17, when the
French lost 15,000, and the Russians 10,000 men, and
the Russians still kept the city. But next day, when the
French again advanced against it, they found it deserted.
For this the Russian general, Barclay de Tolly, was deprived
of his command, forasmuch as he had given up a
holy city to the enemy without fighting a pitched battle
for its preservation.</p>

<p>But, to proceed somewhat chronologically, we must
remember that, on July 22, Wellington gained a great
victory at Salamanca, where the French lost eleven pieces
of cannon, two eagles, and six colours, one general, 136<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
other officers, and 7,000 prisoners. The general public did
not know this news till the 4th of August, and the illuminations
in its honour did not take place till the 17th, 18th,
and 19th of August. It is to this event, doubtless, that
the following refers.</p>

<p>In September 1812 was published a caricature of
‘British Welcome or a Visit from the Bantam to the Lion.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though Bantam Boney claps his wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet this we may rely on:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’ll turn his tail and run away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whene’er he meets the Lion.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">And that is precisely as he is represented in the caricature.
The pursuing lion says, ‘So, my little Bantam, you
are come to pay me a visit&mdash;Well lets have a shake of
your claw.’ But the bantam, with a very terrified expression
of countenance, declines: ‘Excusé moi, Mons<sup>r</sup> le
Lion, you gripe too hard.’</p>

<p>The battle of Borodino (or, as the French call it, Moskowa)
was fought on September 7, and was, probably, the
bloodiest of all Napoleon’s battles, but it laid Moscow
open to the conqueror.</p>

<p>The French entered Moscow on September 14, a day
that Napoleon must have bitterly rued. I do not think
the burning of this city could be better told than by
Napoleon’s own words<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a> </span>‘Had it not been for that fire at
Moscow, I should have succeeded. I would have wintered
there. There were in that city about forty thousand
citizens, who were, in a manner, slaves. For you must
know that the Russian nobility keep their vassals in a sort
of slavery. I would have proclaimed liberty to all the
slaves in Russia, and abolished vassalage and nobility.
This would have procured me the union of an immense
and powerful party. I would either have made a peace at
Moscow, or else I would have marched the next year to
Petersburg.</p>

<p>‘Alexander was assured of it, and sent his diamonds,
valuables, and ships to England. Had it not been for that
fire, I should have succeeded in everything. I beat them,
two days before, in a great action at Moskowa; I attacked
the Russian army of two hundred and fifty thousand
strong, entrenched up to their necks, with ninety thousand,
and totally defeated them. Seventy thousand Russians
lay upon the field. They had the impudence to say that
they had gained the battle, though two days after, I
marched into Moscow. I was in the midst of a fine city,
provisioned for a year, for in Russia they always lay in
provisions for several months before the frost sets in.
Stores of all kinds were in plenty. The houses of the
inhabitants were well provided, and many had left their
servants to attend upon us. In most of them there was a
note left by the proprietor, begging the French officers
who took possession to take care of their furniture and
other things: that they had left every article necessary for
our wants, and hoped to return in a few days, when the
Emperor Alexander had accommodated matters, at which
time they would be happy to see us. Many ladies remained
behind. They knew that I had been in Berlin
and Vienna with my armies, and that no injury had been
done to the inhabitants; and, moreover, they expected a
speedy peace. We were in hopes of enjoying ourselves
in winter quarters, with every prospect of success in
the spring. Two days after our arrival, a fire was discovered,
which, at first, was not supposed to be alarming,
but to have been caused by the soldiers kindling their fires
too near the houses, which were chiefly of wood. I was
angry at this, and issued very strict orders on the subject
to the commandants of regiments and others.</p>

<p>‘The next day it had advanced, but still not so as to
give serious alarm. However, afraid that it might gain
upon us, I went out on horseback, and gave every direction
to extinguish it. The next morning a violent wind
arose, and the fire spread with the greatest rapidity.
Some hundred miscreants, hired for that purpose, dispersed
themselves in different parts of the town, and, with
matches, which they concealed under their cloaks, set fire
to as many houses to windward as they could, which was
easily done, in consequence of the combustible materials
of which they were built. This, together with the violence
of the wind, rendered every effort to extinguish the fire
ineffectual. I, myself, narrowly escaped with life. In
order to shew an example, I ventured into the midst of
the flames, and had my hair and eyebrows singed, and my
clothes burnt off my back; but it was in vain, as they had
destroyed most of the pumps, of which there were above a
thousand; out of all these, I believe that we could only
find one that was serviceable. Besides, the wretches that
had been hired by Rostopchin ran about in every quarter,
disseminating fire with their matches, in which they were
but too much assisted by the wind.</p>

<p>‘This terrible conflagration ruined everything. I was
prepared for everything but this. It was unforeseen, for
who would have thought that a nation would have set its
capital on fire? The inhabitants themselves did all they
could to extinguish it, and several of them perished in
their endeavours. They also brought before us numbers
of the incendiaries, with their matches, as among such a
<i>popolazzo</i> we never could have discovered them ourselves.
I caused about two hundred of these wretches to be
shot.</p>

<p>‘Had it not been for this fatal fire, I had everything
my army wanted: excellent winter quarters; stores of all
kinds were in plenty; and the next year would have
decided it. Alexander would have made peace, or I would
have been in Petersburg.’ I asked if he thought that he
could entirely subdue Russia. ‘No,’ replied Napoleon;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>‘but I would have caused Russia to make such a peace as
suited the interests of France. I was five days too late in
quitting Moscow. Several of the generals were burnt out
of their beds. I, myself, remained in the Kremlin until
surrounded by flames. The fire advanced, seized the
Chinese and India warehouses, and several stores of oil
and spirits, which burst forth in flames, and overwhelmed
everything.</p>

<p>‘I then retired to a country-house of the Emperor
Alexander’s, distant about a league from Moscow, and you
may figure to yourself the intensity of the fire, when I tell
you that you could scarcely bear your hands upon the
walls or windows on the side next to Moscow, in consequence
of their heated state.</p>

<p>‘It was the spectacle of a sea and billows of fire, a sky
and clouds of flame; mountains of red rolling flames, like
immense waves of the sea, alternately bursting forth, and
elevating themselves to skies of fire, and then sinking into
the ocean of flame below. Oh! it was the most grand,
the most sublime, and the most terrific sight the world
ever beheld.’</p>

<p>Napoleon, however, returned to the Kremlin on September
20, and, the main portion of the building being
uninjured, a theatre was improvised therein. Early in
October, he stated his determination to march on St. Petersburg,
but never acted on it. Instead, he entered into
negotiations for peace. Snow began to fall on October 13,
a portent of an early winter, and winter quarters must be
found. Events, however, did not march as he would have
had them. On the 18th the Russians, under Beningsen,
attacked and defeated Murat, and on the 19th Napoleon
left Moscow, and the famous flight from thence began.
Of the horrors of that flight, it is hardly the province of
this work to dilate upon&mdash;mine is more to chronicle the
feeling in England with regard to the events then passing.
It may be said that it was bad taste to caricature such an
appalling disaster&mdash;but when did a question of taste deter
a satirist or caricaturist? Take, as an instance, an event
which many of us well remember, the death of the Emperor
Nicholas of Russia in 1855. That solemn event<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
might well have been passed by, but it was food to the
caricaturist, and he made money out of it. See ‘Punch’
of March 10, 1855, and note the ghastly cartoon of
‘General Février turned Traitor. “<i>Russia has Two Generals
in whom she can confide&mdash;Generals Janvier and
Février.</i>” Speech of the late Emperor of Russia.’</p>

<p>‘Jack Frost attacking Boney in Russia’ was published
in November 1812. A fearful-looking monster, mounted
on a northern bear, pursues Bonaparte (who flees), pelting
him all the way with huge snowballs. Napoleon is on
skates, and holds his poor frost-bitten nose, crying out,
‘By gar, Monsieur Frost this is a much colder Reception
than I expected. I never experienced such a pelting before&mdash;I
find I must take care of my nose, as well as my toes.
Pray forgive me this time, and I swear by S<sup>t</sup> Dennis
never to enter your dominion again.’ Jack Frost makes
answer, ‘What, Master Boney! have I caught you at last.
I’ll teach you Russian fare. Take that, and that, as a
relish, and digest it.’</p>

<p>‘General Frost shaveing Little Boney’ (December 1,
1812) is very grim in its humour. Bonaparte begs, but in
vain, for pity: ‘Pray Brother General, have Mercy. Don’t
overwhelm me with your hoary element. You have so
nipped me, that my very teeth chatter. O dear&mdash;I am
quite chop fallen.’ But the unrelenting and unpitying
Frost replies, ‘Invade my Country, indeed! I’ll shave,
freeze, and bury you in snow, you little Monkey.’</p>

<p>‘Polish Diet with French Desert’ is the title of a caricature
published December 8, 1812. It represents Bonaparte
spitted, and being roasted before an enormous fire,
on which is being cooked a frying-pan full of frogs, which,
however, jump out of it into the fire. A Westphalian bear
is turning the spit and jeering at the poor victim. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>‘How
do you like <i>Benningsen baisting</i>, Master Boney? and your
Frogs?’ This ‘Benningsen baisting’ is being very liberally
supplied to Boney by a gigantic Russian, who holds a
huge ladleful of it in one hand, whilst with the other he
grasps a red-hot poker of Russian iron. This ferocious
Cossack says, ‘I’ll Roast&mdash;Beast (baste)&mdash;Dish&mdash;&amp; Devour
you! He smoaks Brother Bruin&mdash;another turn and he is
done.’ Poor Napoleon, in his agony, calls out, ‘Our situation
may be fun to you, Mr. Bear&mdash;but Death to us.’</p>

<p>The following shows the estimation in which Bonaparte’s
bulletins were held by the English.</p>

<p>In December 1812 G. Cruikshank gave his idea of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
‘Boney hatching a Bulletin, or Snug Winter Quarters.’
With the exception of one Frenchman, who wears pieces
of board for snow-shoes, and who exclaims, ‘By Gar, he is
almost lost!!’ Boney and all his army are up to their
necks in snow. A general asks him, ‘Vat de devil shall ve
say in de Bulletin?’ Boney replies, ‘Say!!!! why say we
have got into comfortable Winter Quarters, and that the
weather is very fine, and will last 8 days longer. Say we
have got plenty of Soup Maigre, plenty of Minced Meat&mdash;Grill’d
Bears fine eating&mdash;driving <i>Cut-us-off</i> to the Devil.

<p>There is another caricature of Napoleon’s escape from
the Cossacks, by G. Cruikshank, published some time in
1813, entitled ‘The Narrow escape, or Boney’s Grand Leap
<i>à la Grimaldi</i>!! No sooner had Napoleon alighted &amp;
entered a miserable house for refreshment, than a party of
Cossacks rushed in after him. Never was Miss Platoff so
near Matrimony!!! Had not the Emperor been very
alert at Vaulting, and leapt through the Window, with the
nimbleness of an Harlequin, while his faithful followers
were fighting for his life, there would, probably, have been
an end at once to that Grand Bubble, the French Empire.’
There is nothing particular about this picture; it is the
same as the others&mdash;the same Cossacks, and the same
episode of the leap.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the last caricatures of this year is a very elaborate
picture&mdash;‘The Arms and Supporters of Napoleon Bonaparte
the self created Emperor, alias the Corsican, and
now the Curse of Europe.’ It was published December
1812, but the artist is unknown, which is a pity, as the
execution is very good. The animus that inspired it will
be seen in the following Explanation, which accompanies
<span class="locked">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Crest represents the World, which, England and Sweden
excepted, is set on fire everywhere by the incendiary Corsican;
his bloody actions and designs are expressed by the bloody hand
and dagger reaching towards Spain. Tyranny, Hypocrisy, Barbarity
and Villany are his standards, which are distinguishable
through the smoke, and the fire, and have nearly enveloped the
whole Globe.</p>

<p>His supporters are The French Devil, and the Corsican
Devil.</p>

<p>The French Devil, or <i>le diable boiteux</i>, formerly a Nobleman
and a priest: any body may easily guess that he, and Talleyrand,
are one and the same creature: by the hour glass he indicates,
however, that time is running away, and that Boney’s downfall is
fast approaching. The Gallic cock destroying religion is his
emblem.</p>

<p>The Corsican Devil, who, being intoxicated with unbounded
ambition, wears an Iron crown ornamented with thorns: he cuts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
down the cap of liberty, because tyranny is his idol. The Serpent
and the hyena are very proper emblems of his infamous character
and conduct.</p>

<p class="center larger"><i>Description of the Arms divided into Eight Quarters.</i></p>

<p>1. The Mushroom on a dunghill denotes his descent, or origin
of family. The Crocodile expresses his treacherous transactions
in Egypt, his apostacy, and his cowardly desertion from his army.
The bloody hand, the guillotine, and the black heart, can only
belong to such a monster.</p>

<p>2. Represents the shooting of 800 defenceless Turkish prisoners,
near the town of Jaffa, ordered very coolly by the monster
Boney.</p>

<p>3. Shews the poisoning his own sick soldiers in the hospital at
Jaffa, by his express orders.</p>

<p>4. Exhibits a scene never known before in the Civilized World.
The foul murder (for it cannot be called anything else, though
Boney excuses it by his mock Court Martial) of the Duke
d’Enghien.</p>

<p>5. Here the monster compels the Pope to come to Paris, and
to assist at a blasphemous coronation, where Boney stands upon
no ceremony with the Holy Father. Boney puts on the iron
crown himself with one hand, whilst the other hand is employed
in robbing the Catholic Church of its head.</p>

<p>6. Exhibits another shocking scene; the truly English patriot,
Captain Wright, is put to death, because he will not be a traitor to
his king and country.</p>

<p>7. Here we behold the massacre of the defenceless citizens of
Madrid, on the 2nd of May, 1808.</p>

<p>8. Represents the imprisonment of King Ferdinand the 7th
because he will not renounce the Crown of Spain, nor marry
Boney’s niece.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Motto is taken from Proverbs, chapter xxviii. verse
15&mdash;‘As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear, so is a wicked
ruler over the poor people.’</p>

<p>On December 16 of this year was published an <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>‘Extraordinary
Gazette’ which perfectly electrified this country.
It contained detailed reports of the successes over the
French&mdash;news which filled every English heart with
joy.</p>

<p>The ‘Times’ of December 17 says:&mdash;‘We hardly know
the terms in which we are to address the people of this
and every other European country, on the subject of the
<i>Extraordinary Gazette</i> contained in this day’s paper. It
does more than confirm our hopes&mdash;it does more than
justify the ardent expressions of triumph, in which we
indulged yesterday. And really, in speaking of the successes
of the Russians, we are obliged to abate the excess
of our joy. Not from any doubt of their magnitude, or
reality, for upon these our countrymen may rely; but
from mere apprehension, lest the vicissitude of human
affairs, which does not usually suffer mankind to exult
beyond measure upon any occasion whatever, should, by
we know not what unexpected reverse, abate somewhat of
the transcendent felicity which is promised the world, by
the overthrow, and disgrace, of its most detested and
detestable tyrant. We shall only say, therefore, in so
many words, that Buonaparte is wholly defeated in Russia;
he is conquered, and a fugitive. And what can we say
more? We have seen his army pass from victory to victory;
we have seen it overthrow kingdoms, and subjugate
realms,&mdash;insult sovereigns, and oppress peasants&mdash;violate
every human right, and diffuse every species of human
misery. And now where is it? Where shall we look for
it? “A wide and capable destruction hath swallowed it
up.” In this awful event we rather admire in humility the
dispensations of Providence, than exult with pride over
the fall of a haughty foe; it is hardly to be viewed as an
occurrence between man and man, or between nation and
nation; but as a divine judgment upon the earth.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
To give an idea of the state of tension at which men’s
minds then were held, I may be pardoned if I give the
following extract<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>: ‘He [Professor Sedgwick] gave a
curious account of Commemoration Day, on December 16,
1812. He was then a Fellow, and, on that day, not feeling
well, had not been drinking his port wine so freely in the
Combination Room, as it was, in those days, the custom of
the Fellows to do. A man, he said, who did not then drink
pretty hard, was considered a milksop. Leaving the other
Fellows over their wine, he went to the gate, where the
porter gave him a Newspaper, on opening which, he found
the official announcement by Napoleon of the destruction
of his grand army (<i>sic</i>). With this news he returned to
the Combination Room, and there read the tidings, to the
intense joy and excitement of all present. <i>Old and young</i>,
he said, <i>wept like children</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>The Russians estimated the French losses by capture
from their first invasion of Russia to December 26, 1812,
at 41 generals, 1,298 inferior officers, 167,510 non-commissioned
officers and privates, and 1,131 pieces of cannon.</p>

<p>Buturlin estimated the total loss sustained by the
French in the Russian campaign at ‘Slain in battle, one
hundred and twenty-five thousand; died from fatigue,
hunger, and cold, one hundred and thirty-two thousand;
prisoners (comprehending forty-eight generals, three thousand
officers, and upwards of one hundred and ninety
thousand men), one hundred and ninety-three thousand;
total, four hundred and fifty thousand,’ and this takes no
count of the thousands of non-combatants who perished.</p>

<p>The destruction of his army, his crushing defeat, and
Mallet’s conspiracy, all determined Napoleon to return to
France, and he reached Paris about half-past eleven at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
night on December 18. How different from his hitherto
triumphal entries! Maria Louisa had retired to rest,
and was woke by the cries of her attendants, who were
frightened at the sight of a man muffled up in furs, not
knowing he was their august master. And thus he slunk
home!</p>

<p>In June 1813 was published ‘Naps glorious return or
the conclusion of the Russian Campaign.</p>

<p class="in0">In this plate we see Maria Louisa preparing to go to bed,
Madame Letitia, Napoleon’s mother, pulling off her stockings.
The old lady cries out, ‘Ah, de Ghost!! de Ghost
of mon Nap.’ The Empress is frightened, and exclaims,
‘Jesu Maria, what is this so woe begone? It cannot be my
husband, he promised to return in triumph, it must be his
Ghost.’ Even his little boy, the King of Rome, doubts his
identity. He is getting ready for bed, and already has his
nightcap on, but he runs away in fright, crying, ‘That ain’t
my Papa!! he said he would bring me some Russians to
cut up. I think they have cut him up.’ Whilst Bonaparte,
who enters in a most dilapidated condition, with his
toes coming through his boots, his sword and scabbard
broken, and his face besmeared with dirt, calls out dolefully,
‘Me voici! your poor Nap escape from de Cossack&mdash;by
gar, I jump out of de window for my life, and I now
jump into bed vid my wife.’ The ladies-in-waiting have
fainted, and one, having left the warming-pan in the bed,
has set it on fire, and it is burning brightly.</p>

<p class="in0">Napoleon, with one of his generals, is in full retreat, in a
sledge, leaving his army pursued by the Russians, and the
ground strewn with dead men and horses. The general
asks, ‘Will your Majesty write the Bulletin?’ ‘No,’ answers
Napoleon, ‘you write it! tell them we have left the
Army all well, quite gay, in excellent Quarters, plenty of
provisions&mdash;that we travelled in great Style&mdash;received
everywhere with congratulations, and that I have almost
compleated the <i>repose of Europe</i>.’</p>

<p>Napoleon was not the man to sit still under defeat, and,
very shortly after his return, he set himself to repair losses.
These were heavy; there was an entirely new artillery to
be provided, remounts for his cavalry, and, what was of the
greatest importance, a new army to be made. This he got
by anticipating the conscription of 1814, and the patriotism
of his people helped him largely with the remainder. The
caricaturist has sharp eyes, and he produced ‘Bonaparte
reviewing his Conscripts,’ which is an anonymous picture,
dated February 23, 1813, and represents the Emperor, who
is mounted on a jackass, and who has a very motley following,
reviewing his Dutch light horse, who are mounted
on frogs, every man with a keg of Hollands under his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
There is a very comical picture of ‘Bonaparte addressing
the Legislative Body’ after his return from Russia
(designed December 1, 1812, published February 24, 1813).
Here the discomfited Emperor is in very sorry plight: his
coat is in tatters, his breeches cover only a very small portion
of his legs, his toes are well out of his boots, and he
in vain tries, with his handkerchief, to stop the tears which
flow so copiously, as he says, ‘I myself entered Russia.
The Russian Armies could not stand before our armies.
The French Arms were constantly victorious&mdash;A swarm of
Tartars turned their parricidal hands against the finest
provinces of that vast Empire which they had been called
upon to defend&mdash;But the excessive and premature rigour
of the winter brought down a heavy calamity upon my
army&mdash;In a few nights I saw everything change.&mdash;The
misfortunes produced by rigour of hoar frosts, have been
made apparent in all their extent&mdash;I experienced great
losses&mdash;they would have broken my heart, if under such
circumstances, I could have been accessible to any other
sentiments than those of the interest&mdash;the glory&mdash;and the
future prosperity of my people&mdash;I have signed with the
Pope, a Concordat, which terminates all the differences
that unfortunately had arisen in the Church&mdash;The French
Dynasty reigns&mdash;and will reign in Spain&mdash;I am satisfied
with all my allies&mdash;I will abandon none of them&mdash;The
Russians shall return into their frightful climate.’</p>

<p>On March 6, 1813, appeared ‘The Wags of Paris or
Downfall of Nap the Great. “But the circumstance said
to have annoyed the Emperor most, was, some Wags of
Paris taking of Dogs, and for sev’ral nights together, tied
Tin Kettles to their tails, and labels round their necks,
with the words ‘Run away from Moscow,’ &amp; giving them
liberty, they ran with velocity, and fury, in various directions,
to the great Entertainment of the Parisians.” <i>Courier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
1 Mar. 1813.</i>’ One of these dogs has got between Napoleon’s
legs, and is throwing him down, while he calls out,
‘Sacré Dieu!! Plot Anglais!! Not a Dog in Paris but
shall feel my Vengeance!! Shoot! hang them all! Not
the Empress’s Favorite shall escape. D&mdash;d John Bull&mdash;d&mdash;d
Russian bears, not content with hunting Me from the
<i>frightful climate</i>, but sends Mad Dogs to Hunt Me in my
own Capital!!!’ The Governor of Paris replies, ‘Sire, be
pacified. All the Dogs in Paris shall be tried by a Military
Commission for a Conspiracy against your Sacred Majesty.
All John Bull’s bull dogs shall be destroyed! Pomeranian
Danish Mastiffs &amp; all but your Majesty’s own breed of
<i>Blood hounds</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Anticipation for <i>Boney</i>&mdash;or, a Court Martial on the
Cowardly Deserter from the Grand Army,’ by G. Cruikshank
(March 6, 1813), is an imaginary scene of what
might happen, did the Emperor meet with his deserts.
The Parisian mob have the upper hand, and a cobbler has
been proclaimed Emperor in his stead. Before this awful
being, Boney is dragged by a ferocious butcher, who, with
an enormous axe in one hand, holds in the other the halter
which encircles the neck of poor trembling Boney, who is
on his knees, with upraised, supplicating hands. The <i>sans-culotte</i>
Emperor Crispin is seated in a chair, on a <i>haut pas</i>;
a cap of liberty, on a pole, behind him. In one hand he
holds a hammer, and one foot rests on a lapstone. Pointing
to the wretched culprit, he says, ‘Well! you are found
guilty of cowardly deserting from the grand army, and, by
repairing here with your cobbling defence, you have done
a d&mdash;d bad job for yourself, and, as your time waxes near
its end, I would have you prepare your Sole for your Last.
So off with his head, Mr. Butcher.’ The butcher looks
unutterable things at Boney, saying, ‘Ah, D&mdash;n you we’ll
cut off your head, and your Tail too!’ The poor craven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
wretch, with streaming eyes, and upstanding hair, pitifully
supplicates that at all events his head should be spared.
But the yelling mob cry out, ‘Off with his head.’ ‘Aye,
Aye, he has butchered Millions.’ And the women and
children scream, ‘Where’s my husband, wretch?’ ‘Where’s
my Father?’ ‘Where’s my Daddy?’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>Drilling went on, a necessary step to the formation of
a new army, and the French temperament is well shown
in a caricature, published in April 1813, of ‘Nap reviewing
the Grand Army, or the Conquest of Russia anticipated,’
in which, during the march past, he points to his
soldiers with his sword, and says to two of his generals,
‘With this Army will I crush those Russian Scourges, and
make all Nations tremble at my wrath.’ One general, in
his enthusiasm, exclaims, ‘Parbleu! vid dis Armée ve vil
conquer de Heaven!!!’ The other, evidently an Anglophobe,
says, ‘And de Hell too, dat we may send dere de
dam Anglais.’</p>

<p>In April Napoleon judged that his army was in a fit
state to take the field, and the caricaturist’s idea of a
council of war is humorously told in the picture of ‘Boney
and the Gay lads of Paris calculating for the next Triumphal
entry into Moscow.’ This broadside, which made
its appearance in April 1813, represents Bonaparte and his
generals in council. The latter are in different stages of
dilapidation, some having lost their noses, others with
their feet bound up, and all more or less suffering from
frost-bite. One, pointing to a map, says, ‘By Gar, Sire,
we had better go to Petersburgh at once.’ Napoleon
replies, ‘Aye, and then we can march to Siberia, and
release the Exiles, who will gladly join us, and abjure
their tyrant.’ Two generals, in conversation together, do
not seem to relish the plan. One remarks, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>‘Sacre Dieu, I
no like de Russia Campaign. I lose my nose, my fingers,
and toes, in de last.’ And the other replies, ‘Eh bien, den
now we lose all our odds and ends.’ The letterpress is as

<span class="subhead">THE ARMISTICE&mdash;BATTLE OF VITTORIA&mdash;DEFEAT AT LEIPSIC&mdash;THE
BRIDGE BLOWN UP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>An armistice was signed between the allies and Napoleon
on June 4, 1813, to last till July 20: six days’ notice
to be given of the recommencement of hostilities. But
Wellington seems to have disregarded it; for, on June 21,
he defeated the French army commanded by Joseph
Bonaparte, who had Marshal Jourdan under him, at
Vittoria; completely routing them, and taking 151 pieces
of cannon, 415 ammunition waggons, all their baggage,
besides many prisoners.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the caricaturist did not omit his opportunity.
‘Mad Nap breaking the Armistice’ (June 1813)
is said to be taken ‘from the original Picture at Dresden.’<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
Two messengers bring him their reports. One is ‘English
near Bayonne, Rising in South of France, 200,000 men
joined the Bourbon Standard, Revolt at Toulon, Discontent
at Paris, All Spain evacuated, and more losses.’ The
other messenger tells the furious Emperor: ‘Diable! Your
Grand Army in Spain is totally routed, 180 Cannon, 400
Ammunition Waggons, All the Baggage! 9000 head of
Cattle, Military Chest full of money taken. Your brother,
King Joey, gallop’d away on horseback, Devil knows
where! M. Jourdain has lost his wig and stick! and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Enemy pursuing in all directions.’ Bonaparte is in a
towering rage, brandishing a poker, and kicking the last
messenger, to whom he roars out: ‘Away, base slaves.
Fresh Torments! Vile Cowards! Poltroon Joe! Traitor
Jourdain! Cursed Anglais! I’ll make Heaven and Earth
tremble for this! but ’tis lies! base lies! Give me my
horse, I’ll mount, and away to Spain! England! Wellington!
and Hell! to drive Lucifer from his Infernal Throne
for Treachery to <span class="smcap">Me</span>!!’ A frightened general standing by
exclaims: ‘My Poor Master! is it come to this? I must
whip on this Strait Jacket, or he’ll break all our bones, as
well as the Armistice.’</p>

<p>As a corollary to this, although it does not belong to
Napoleon proper, I cannot abstain from noticing a picture
published July 9, 1813, of ‘Jourdan and King Joe or Off
they go&mdash;a Peep at the French Commanders at the battle
of Vittoria.’ The British troops have routed the French,
who fly in all directions; King Joseph and Marshal
Jourdan, in the foreground, are doing the same. Says the
king: ‘Parbleu Mons<sup>r</sup> Marshal, we must run! a pretty
piece of business we have made of it. If my Brother Nap
sends for me to the Congress, the Devil a clean shirt have
they left me! Could you not try your hand at a Convention
again, my dear Jourdan! as our friend Junot did in
Portugal?’</p>

<p>But Jourdan replies: ‘Convention! No, ma foi! there is
no tricking ce Lord Wellington, we have nothing to trust
to but our heels, but I dont think they will save us, you
need not be uneasy about a clean shirt for the Congress,
Mons<sup>r</sup> Joe. Allons donc, run like de Devil! run like
your Brother Nap from Russia.’</p>

<p>George Cruikshank drew (July 8, 1813) a very humorous
picture of <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>‘Boney receiving an account of the
Battle of Vittoria&mdash;or&mdash;the Little Emperor in a great
Passion!’ A ragged postilion, mounted on the back of a
kneeling soldier, holds up a long roll: ‘King Joseph has
been defeated by Wellington with the loss of 151 pieces of
Cannon, 415 Ammunition Waggons, Bag and Baggage,
Provisions, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. The French have <i>one</i> very fine
little Howitzer left. One Quarter of the Army is killed,
the other wounded, the third Quarter taken prisoners, and
the English are playing the Devil with the rest.’</p>

<p>Napoleon, before his throne, is stamping, tearing his
hair, and flourishing his sword, to the undisguised terror
of his Mameluke Roustem; he roars out: ‘Oh!&mdash;!&mdash;!&mdash;!&mdash;!&mdash;!&mdash;!&mdash;!
oh! Hell and the Devil! Death and D&mdash;na&mdash;on!!!
that cursed fiend John Bull will drive me mad!
Villains! Villains! ’tis all a lie, ’tis false as Hell, I say!!
away with the &mdash;&mdash; scroll&mdash;it sears my very eyeballs!!!
I’ll cut it in Ten Thousand pieces&mdash;I’ll kick ye to the Devil&mdash;away
with it!!!’ Russia, Prussia, and Austria are spectators.
Russia suggests: ‘Now is the time!’ In this
Prussia cordially agrees, and says to Austria: ‘Now or
never, will you not join us?’</p>

<p>Only a portion is given of G. Cruikshank’s ‘A Scene
after the Battle of Vittoria, or More Trophies for Whitehall!!!’
(July 10, 1813). The Duke of Wellington, on
horseback, is receiving the captured colours, &amp;c., which his
officers lay at his feet. He is evidently satisfied with the
result, for he exclaims: ‘Why! here’s enough for three
Nights Illumination!’ A general replies: ‘Three times
three, my lord.’ One presents him with a <i>bâton</i>: ‘Here’s
Marshal Jourdan’s Rolling pin’; and another, bringing in a
captured standard, points to the group which forms our
illustration, saying: ‘And here comes their last Cannon!!’</p>

<p>The following caricature will do for any time during
the year:&mdash;‘John Bull teazed by an Earwig’ bears only
the date of 1813, and is by an unknown artist. The old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
boy is at his frugal meal of bread, cheese, and beer, and
has been reading the ‘True Briton,’ when he is interrupted
by little Boney, who, perched on his shoulder, pricks his
cheek with a Lilliputian sword. John Bull turns round
half angrily, and says: ‘I tell you what, you Vermin! if
you won’t let me eat my bread and cheese in peace, and
comfort, I’ll blow you away, depend upon it.’ To which
the insect replies: ‘I will have the cheese, you Brute you&mdash;I
have a great mind to annihilate you, you great, over
grown, Monster!!!’</p>

  <div class="caption">A SCENE AFTER THE BATTLE OF VITTORIA, OR, MORE TROPHIES FOR
WHITEHALL!!!</div></div>

<p>In October 1813 came out an etching of ‘Tom Thumb
and the Giant, or a forced March to Franckfort. <i>Kings
are his Centinels, vide Sheridan’s speech.</i> A letter from
Stralsund states that Buonaparte, on his journey to Paris,
sent a Courier to the King of Wi&mdash;&mdash;g<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> with orders for
him to proceed to Franckfort on the Maine, and the latter
would meet him there accordingly.’ Tom Thumb, Napoleon,
on horseback, prods on the King with his sword, telling
him at the same time: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>‘On, Sir, to Franckfort, and
there await my coming.’ The poor fat King, with perspiring
brows, piteously exclaims: ‘Well, I am going as fast
as I can&mdash;&mdash; Pretty work this for a Man of my Importance!!
Was it for this you put a Crown upon my
head!’</p>

<p>Napoleon’s power was rapidly drawing to an end, and
the crushing defeat he received at Leipsic on October 16,
17, 18, 19, gave it its death-blow. The news was promulgated
throughout England by a ‘London Gazette Extraordinary’
of November 3. The ‘Times’ of the same
date had hinted of reverses sustained by Napoleon, and
on November 4 broke into jubilation thus: ‘“Justice
demands the sacrifice of the Tyrant,”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> such was the sentiment
which concluded our last article,&mdash;a sentiment not
dictated by any feeling of transient growth, but adopted
after long and serious reflection on what is due to the
moral interests, which are the best and surest interests of
nations. The French people will now determine between
the sacrifice of their Tyrant, and sacrifices of a very different
description, sacrifices of their lives, their children,
their treasure, their honour.</p>

<p>‘We had already communicated to our readers the
private information which we had received, stating that he
had sustained “dreadful reverses” in a “series of actions,”
which had caused him “not only a great diminution in the
numbers of his men, but also a serious loss of artillery”;
and that he had himself “escaped with the utmost difficulty
to a place of comparative, and but comparative, safety.”
Such were the accounts which we believed “would be found
to contain a very moderate statement of the Tyrant’s
losses”; but we own our most sanguine hopes have been
exceeded by the Official Statements received yesterday by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Government, and made public; first, in a brief form, by a
letter from Lord <span class="smcap">Castlereagh</span> to the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span>, and
a Bulletin from the Foreign Office; and, afterwards, in
most gratifying detail, by an <i>Extraordinary Gazette</i>.’</p>

<p>The ‘Morning Post’ of the same date heads the intelligence
as ‘The most Glorious and Important News ever
received;’ and the Prince Regent, who opened Parliament
on November 4, alluded to it in his speech in these terms:
‘The annals of Europe afford no examples of victories
more splendid, and decisive, than those which have been
recently achieved in Saxony.’ London was brilliantly illuminated,
and joy reigned throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>One of the first caricatures on the subject is the ‘Execution
of two celebrated Enemies of Old England, and
their Dying Speeches, 5 Nov. 1813,’ which was by Rowlandson
(published November 27, 1813), and is stated to
be a representation of a ‘Bonfire at Thorpe Hall near
Louth, Lincolnshire, on 5 Nov. 1813, given by the Rev.
W.&nbsp;C. to the boys belonging to the Seminary at Louth, in
consequence of the arrival of news of the Decisive Defeat
of Napoleon Buonaparte, by the Allies, at 11 o’clock on y<sup>e</sup>
4th, &amp; Louth Bells ringing all night.’</p>

<p>Guy Faux, who is got up like one of the old watchmen,
is swinging on one gallows, and Napoleon, in traditional
costume, on another, with a roaring bonfire under him.
Men, women, and boys are rejoicing around. ‘Guy Faux’s
Dying Speech. I, Guy Faux, meditating my Country’s
ruin, by the clandestine, and diabolical, means of the Gunpowder
plot, was most fortunately discovered, and brought
to condign punishment, by Old England, and here I bewail
my fate.’ ‘Napoleon Buonaparte’s Dying Speech. I,
Napoleon Buonaparte, flattered by all the French Nation
that I was invincible, have most cruelly, and most childishly,
attempted the subjugation of the world. I have lost my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>

spurned the firm wisdom of the Right Hon. W<sup>m</sup> Pitt, I

<p>Rowlandson drew a ‘Copy of the Transparency exhibited
at Ackermann’s Repository of Arts, During the Illuminations
of the 5th and 6th of November 1813, in honour
of the splendid victories obtained by the Allies over the
Armies of France, at Leipsig and its Environs.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">‘The Two Kings of Terror.</p>

<p>‘This Subject, representing the two Tyrants, viz. the
Tyrant <i>Bonaparte</i>, and the Tyrant <i>Death</i>, sitting together
on the Field of Battle, in a manner which promises a more
perfect intimacy immediately to ensue, is very entertaining.
It is also very instructing to observe, that the former is now
placed in a situation, in which all Europe <i>may see through
him</i>. The emblem, too, of the circle of light from mere
<i>vapour</i>, which is so soon <i>extinguished</i>, has a good moral
effect; and as the Gas represents the dying flame, so does
the Drum, on which he is seated, typify the <i>hollow</i>, and
<i>noisy</i> nature of the falling Usurper.</p>

<p>‘The above description of the subject, appeared in the
<i>Sun</i> of Saturday, the 6th of November. These pointed comments
arose from the picture being transparent, and from
a circle, indicative of the strength, and brotherly union, of
the Allies, which surmounted the same, composed of <i>gas</i><a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
of brilliant brightness.’</p></blockquote>

<p>‘Cossack Sports&mdash;or the Platoff Hunt in full cry after
French Game’ (November 9, 1813), shows Leipsic in the
background, and the river Elster, into which the Cossacks,
plunge, in full cry, after the ‘Corsican Fox.’ The Hetman,
Platoff, cries, ‘Hark forward! my boys, get along! he
runs in view&mdash;Yoics, Yoics&mdash;There he goes&mdash;Tally ho!’
His daughter, about whom the story is told (see footnote
p. 148), is in mid stream, lashing her horse, and calling out,
‘Hi! ho! Tally ho! For a husband!’ An army of French
frogs in vain attempt to stop the Cossacks&mdash;they are
routed, and fleeing.</p>

<p>A very cleverly drawn caricature is ‘Caterers&mdash;Boney
Dished&mdash;a Bonne Bouche for Europe’ (November 10, 1813),
and it gives us the sovereigns of Europe seated around a
table, on which is a large dish, in the centre of which poses
Napoleon, surrounded with a garnish of his marshals,
seated, and with their hands tied behind them. The different
sovereigns express their opinions upon the dish. Thus
Russia says, ‘I think Brother of Austria, this dish will be
relish’d by all Europe.’ ‘And I think Brother of Russia
they will admire the <i>garnish</i>!’ ‘Pray let Wurtemburg
join in that dish.’ ‘And Bavaria, if you please.’ Holland
thinks that ‘Donder and Blikins, dat dish will please mein
Vrow.’ Poland says, ‘It is rather too highly seasoned for
my taste, but French.’ The Switzer opines that ‘William
Tell never invented a better dish, I hope we shall have a
taste of it!’ Italy swears ‘By the God of Love! that is
better dish den Maccaroni.’ With tears streaming down
his face, a poor monarch prays, ‘Oh dear! oh dear! I hope
they won’t Dish the poor old King of Saxony.’ Prussia
remarks to England, ‘We must reduce the quantity of irritating
articles, before we can produce it as a finished dish&mdash;What
say you Steward of the Feast?’ who replies, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>‘I
agree with your Highness, John Bull prefers moderation.’</p>

<p>On November 10, 1813, was published ‘The Daw Stript
of his Borrow’d Plumes, <i>vide Gay’s Fables of the Daw
and the other Birds</i>,’ which shows the different birds despoiling
the poor Daw, Napoleon. The double-headed
eagle, Russia, with one beak strips him of his Legion of
Honour, the other head takes off his crown. Austria,
Prussia, and Sweden are rapidly denuding him of his borrowed
plumes; whilst Spain, Poland, and Bohemia are
hovering around. The background is taken up with a
Cossack spitting runaway Frenchmen on his lance.</p>

<p>Rowlandson gives us (November 25, 1813) ‘A Long
pull, a Strong pull, and a pull altogether.’ Here we see the
allies’ ships riding freely on the ocean, the sun of tyranny
setting, and the allies giving all their strength in helping to
float the Texel fleet, which the Dutch are assisting them to
launch. Napoleon and his brother Joseph are in the background,
the former dancing with rage, and crying out, ‘Oh
Brother Joe&mdash;I’m all Fire. My Passion eats me up. Such
unlooked for storms of ill fall on me. It beats down all my
cunning, I cannot bear it. My ears are filled with noise,
my eyes grow dim, and feeble shakings seize every Limb.’
Joseph, whose crown has dropped off, says, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>‘Oh Brother
Nap, brother Nap, we shan’t be left with half a crown
apiece!’</p>

<p>‘The Corsican toad under a harrow’ (Rowlandson,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
November 27, 1813) also alludes to the defection of Holland,
the agonised Emperor calling out, ‘Oh, this heavy
Dutchman! O’ had I enough to bear before!!!’</p>

<p>Rowlandson gives us (November 29, 1813) ‘Dutch
Nightmare, or the Fraternal Hug, returned with a Dutch
Squeeze,’ which represents Napoleon lying on a state bed,
suffering the tortures of nightmare, his incubus being a
very heavy Dutchman, who sits upon his breast calling
out, ‘Orange Boven,’ and puffing his smoke right into the
face of his victim.</p>

<p>Mr. Grego credits Rowlandson with the ‘Head Runner
of Runners from Leipsic Fair’ (March 2, 1814), but both
the design and drawing manifestly show that it is not by
him. On the contrary, its internal evidence clearly shows
it to be a German engraving, and much earlier in date,
the town in the background being labelled Maynz. Napoleon
is here represented as a running courier, and the
speed at which he is going is shown by his being able to
keep pace with a hare. The top of his staff is Charlemagne&mdash;or,
as in the etching, Carolus Magnus. In his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
rapid flight he is losing from his wallet all the things
entrusted to him&mdash;Italy, Holland, Switzerland, the Rheinbund,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>His flight from Leipsic was well caricatured, and one
episode, the premature blowing up of the bridge over the
Elster, came in for severe comment. Colonel Montfort had
orders to blow up the bridge, which was mined, as soon as
the last of the troops had passed over. He, however,
entrusted this duty to a corporal and four miners. The
corporal, hearing shouting and cannonading, thought the
allies were in possession of the city and pursuing the
French forces. He therefore fired the bridge, which blew
up, cutting off the retreat of four <i>corps d’armée</i>, and more
than 200 cannon. Of course, the men so circumstanced
had no option but to yield themselves as prisoners, after
many had been driven into the river and drowned.</p>

<p>‘Grasp all Lose all&mdash;<i>Atlas</i> enraged&mdash;or the punishment
of unqualified ambition’ is the title of a picture (December
1, 1813) which represents Atlas, who is kneeling down,
preparing to drop the whole world on Napoleon. The
latter, who has been touching those parts of the earth
which are in his possession, and boasting, ‘France be mine!
Holland be mine! Italy be mine! Spain and Poland be
mine! Russ, Prussia, Turky, de whole world vil be
mine!!!!’ staggers back, exclaiming, ‘Mons. Atlas, hold
up, dont let it fall on me.’ Atlas, whose look is fearful,
says, ‘When the Friends of Freedom, and Peace, have
stopped your shaking it on my shoulders, and got their
own again, I’ll bear it. Till then you may carry it yourself,
Master Boney.’ Russia and Prussia are rushing away
in fright. Says one, ‘By Gar ’tis true, ’tis fall on you
Head! votre Serviteur! we no stop to be crush vid you.’</p>

<p>‘The Corsican Munchausen humming<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> the Lads of
Paris’ (Rowlandson, December 4, 1813) shews Napoleon
and his son on a stage, upon which is a throne, tottering,
and an overthrown globe. The King of Rome is dressed
in counterpart of his father, with long trailing sword, and
using a stick as a <i>cockhorse</i>. Napoleon is vapouring to
the assembled audience: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>‘Did I not swear I would destroy
Austria? Did I not swear I would destroy Prussia? Did
I not leave the Russians 1200 pieces of cannon to build a
monument of the victory of Moscow? Did I not lead
498,000 men to gather fresh laurels in Russia. Did I not
burn Moscow and leave 400,000 brave soldiers to perish in
the snow for the good of the French Nation? Did I not
swear I would destroy Sweden? Did I not swear I would
have Colonies and Commerce? Did I not build more
ships than you could find sailors for? Did I not burn all
the British Produce bought, and paid for, by my faithful
merchants, before their faces, for the good of them, and my
good people of Paris? Have I not called my troops from
Holland, that they might not winter in that foggy Climate?
Have I not called my troops from Spain, and Portugal, to
the ruin of the English? Did I not change my religion,
and turn Turk, for the good of the French Nation? Have
I not blown up the Corporal for blowing up the Bridge?
Have I not robbed the Churches of twenty flags to send to
my Empress, for the loss of my own flags and Eagles?
And now, for the good of my Empire, Behold! O ye
Lads of Paris! I have put the <i>King of Rome</i> in <i>breeches</i>.’</p>

<p>Rowlandson gives us ‘Funcking<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> the Corsican’ (December
6, 1813). A representation of all the crowned
heads of Europe, each of whom is smoking a pipe very
vigorously, uniting in tormenting Bonaparte with their
tobacco smoke. The little Corsican, who is on the top of
a cask of ‘Real Hollands Geneva,’ is dancing with rage,
and yells out: ‘Oh you base Traitors and Deserters,
Eleven Hundred Thousand Lads of Paris shall roast every
one of you as soon as they can catch you!’ In his excitement
he has split the head of the cask, and there seems
every probability of his disappearing. ‘The fly that sips,
is lost in the sweet.’</p>

<p>‘The Mock Phœnix!!! or a vain attempt to rise again’
is by Rowlandson (December 10, 1813). Napoleon is in a
furnace, which is being diligently stoked and blown by
Russia and Holland. Serpents come from the mouth of
the furnace, and the soots, the products of combustion,
take the form of fiends&mdash;Napoleon is partially consumed,
and his crown is in a blaze.</p>

<p>‘Friends or Foes&mdash;Up he goes&mdash;Sending the Corsican
Munchausen to St. Clouds’ is by Rowlandson (December
12, 1813), and shows the whole of the sovereigns of Europe
combining to toss Napoleon in a blanket.</p>

<p>A most amusing caricature by Rowlandson (December
14, 1813) is <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>‘Political Chemists and German Retorts, or
dissolving the Rhenish confederacy.’ John Bull naturally
finds coal for a ‘German Stove,’ the fire in which a Dutchman
blows with a pair of bellows. All the sovereigns of
Europe stand round, enjoying Boney’s discomfiture. The
Emperor, who is vainly appealing to them, ‘Oh spare me
till the King of Rome is ripe for mischief yet to come,’ is
being put into a glass receiver, and is about to be covered
up. Bernadotte is pouring in a bottle of sulphate of
Swedish iron, and the Pope is hurrying forward with two
bottles, one of fulminating powder, the other a vial of
wrath. The products being distilled from him are Intrigue
and Villainy, Ambition and Folly, Gasconade and Lies, Fire
and Sword, Arrogance and Atrocity, Murder and Plunder.
A Spaniard is pounding at a mortar inscribed ‘Saragossa.’</p>

<p class="in0">Napoleon crowned, and <i>en grande tenue</i>, stands before the
throne, pointing to some trophies borne by soldiers, and
thus addresses the Senate: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>‘Senators! the glorious success
of our Arms has forced me to give way to the impulse
of quitting the field of honour, that I might have the satisfaction
of presenting to my faithful Senate the glorious
trophies of our Victories. Senators! your restless, envious
enemies shall be humbled to the dust; your Emperor wills
it so; this Arrogant Confederacy shall be punished for
their temerity, and our brave Soldiers shall repose in peace.
Senators! for this purpose I shall require the small sum of
250,000,000, a sum the flourishing state of our finance
will easily produce, and, to replace the vacancy made in
my Army, 500,000 (men) from the conscription of 4 years
to come will be all that I demand. Frenchmen, the Will
of your Emperor, and the glory of the great Nation, requires
it.’ The Devil, peeping round from behind the
throne, applauds: ‘That’s right my Boy. Humbug them
out of another conscription to send me, before you come
yourself.’</p>

<p>One Senator, as spokesman, thus addresses Napoleon:
‘Great Emperor of the Great Nation, the Senate devotes the
lives and property of the People to your service.’ But this
does not appear to be the universal consensus of opinion;
for one grumbles, ‘C’est dire un peu trop, cela!’ Another
asks: ‘What has he done with the last Grand Army, that
he wants so many again?’ and one replies: ‘They are
gone to see how their friends in Russia do.’ Another
doubts the authenticity of the trophies: ‘Why! these
trophies belong to our Allies, c’est drôle cela!’</p>

<p>On December 12, 1813, George Cruikshank published
‘Bleeding and Warm Water! or the Allied Doctors bringing
Boney to his Senses.’ Here poor Boney is in very
evil case. With shaven head, and in an ‘Allied strait
waistcoat’ (one sleeve of which is held by Russia, the
other by Poland), he is seated on the stool of Repentance
in a tub of hot water, consisting of a ‘sea of troubles,’
which is warmed by the flames of Moscow. He is surrounded
by all the European sovereigns as doctors, each
of whom prescribes his own remedy. Russia gives, as his
opinion: ‘I have found a constant application of this
Russian <i>Knout</i> to work wonders!!’ John Bull is giving
him a fearful bolus, ‘Invasion of France,’ saying at the
same time, ‘Work away my Masters, I’ll pay you your <i>fees</i>.
Ay, ay, rave and rant, Master Boney, but the Devil will
<i>Bone</i> you at last.’ Holland is trying ‘what <i>Dutch drops</i>
will do,’ by emptying out of a huge cannon a legion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
armed Dutchmen on his shaven head. Poland bleeds him
by stabbing his arm with a lance, and Prussia catches the
blood in a ‘Crown bowl,’ congratulating himself, ‘I think
my <i>Crown</i> Razors have shaved his <i>Crown</i> pretty close.’
Spain is applying a plaster to his back: ‘Here is a Plaster
of Spanish flies for him.’ Poor Boney, one of whose legs
is in the hot water, resists this treatment as far as possible,
and yells out, ‘Hence with your Medicines&mdash;they but drive
me Mad. Curse on your <i>Dutch Drops</i>, your <i>Leipsig Blister</i>,
and your <i>Spanish flies</i>; they have fretted me to what I
am. D&mdash;n your <i>Cossack Lancets</i>, they have drained my
veins, and rendered me poor and vulnerable indeed&mdash;Oh!
how I am fallen&mdash;But I will still struggle&mdash;I will still
be great&mdash;Myriads of Frenchmen still shall uphold the
glory of my name, the grandeur of my Throne, and write
my disgrace in the hearts of ye&mdash;ye wretched creatures of
English gold.’</p>

<p>‘The Head of the Great Nation in a Queer Situation,’
by G. Cruikshank (December 1813), shows frightened
Bonaparte, his magic wand broken, surrounded by his
enemies. Wellington points a huge blunderbuss at him,
telling the others to ‘Take a good aim at the Head,
gentlemen, and we shall soon settle the business.’ Austria,
Prussia, and Russia all point pistols at his head. Prussia
thinks that ‘by Gar, we shall make de Head look like de
Plumb Pudding;’ and Russia says, ‘I’ll rattle a few Snow
balls at his Cranium.’ Holland has a cannon which he is
filling with bales of Orange Boven, saying, ‘I’ll deal out
my oranges to him wholesale.’ From the heavens, the
hand of Justice is putting the ‘Allied Extinguisher’ upon
him. This picture is copied bodily from a French caricature,
‘Le Chef de la Grande Nation dans une triste position.’</p>

<p>On December 25, 1813, was published one of Rowlandson’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
caricatures called the ‘Mock Auction&mdash;or Boney
selling Stolen Goods.’ There is an announcement that
‘speedily will be sold the 13 cantons of Switzerland,’ and,
among the property he has for sale, are the Papal Tiara, and
several crowns, a lot of useless eagles, the kingdom of
Bavaria, twenty flags the property of the Empress, the
kingdom of Prussia, Saxony, kingdom of Westphalia, and
the United Provinces. Some French officers are among
the audience, which includes the crowned heads of Europe.
The crown of Spain is on sale, and is lifted upon high for
inspection. Spain jeeringly asks: ‘That a Crown? It’s
not worth half a crown.’ Napoleon, seeing no chance of
selling it, says: ‘What! no bidding for the Crown of
Spain. Then take the other crowns and lump them into
one lot.’ Maria Louisa carries the King of Rome, who is
like a little monkey, and who exclaims: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>‘I suppose daddy
will put us up for sale.’</p>

<span class="subhead">L’HOMME ROUGE&mdash;NAPOLEON’S SUPERSTITION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>This ends the caricatures for the year 1813, at the close
of which Napoleon was in Paris. Wellington and Soult
were fighting their prolonged duel in Spain, to the great
advantage of the former. One after another did the French
garrisons surrender, until, at the close of the year, Santona
alone remained to the French. His troops, shut up in
garrison in Germany and Prussia, were in very evil case,
from hardships and sickness. St. Cyr abandoned Dresden,
and all the garrison were made prisoners of war. Stettin
surrendered, and the Dutch revolted; whilst at home the
life-blood of the nation was being drained by a new conscription
of 300,000 men, and the taxes were increased by
one half.</p>

<p>And here, as well as at any other place, I may introduce
Napoleon’s familiar spirit, ‘<i>l’Homme Rouge</i>.’ The
belief in ‘the red man,’ in connection with the Emperor,
was very widely spread; but details of his personal appearance,
and the times of his visits, are rarely to be met with,
and are invariably contradictory. Napoleon’s success had
been so marvellous, that it is easily to be imagined it was
popularly ascribed to supernatural agency.</p>

<p>In a small and very rare French book,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> is an account of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a> </span>‘<i>The little red and green men, or the genius of Evil triumphing
over the genius of Good</i>. Many persons, astonished at the
success of Buonaparte in all which he undertook, asked by
what tutelary divinity he was protected?</p>

<p>‘Some said, It is Europe which is being destroyed by
itself, an effect natural to every country, over-populated,
and too flourishing&mdash;Was it not thus with Egypt, Greece,
Judea, and Rome? Others, less philosophic, but easier
given to conjecture, said, When he was in Egypt he
several times absented himself from his staff.&mdash;Somebody
generally came to him before he fought a battle, or undertook
any enterprise.</p>

<p>‘He frequently repeated, <i>God has given me the strength
and the will to overcome all obstacles</i>. There was something
supernatural ... and thenceforth endless questions were
asked of those who were with him in the Egyptian expedition.
At length, by dint of research, a part of the truth was
discovered, which is as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘On the eve of the battle of the Pyramids, Buonaparte,
at the council which was held in the morning, formally
opposed the proposition to give battle. In the afternoon
of that day, having gone, with some of the officers of his
suite, to make a reconnaissance, and having approached
one of the monuments of the pride of the Pharaohs,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> he
suddenly saw, coming out from it, a little man clothed in a
long red robe, his head being adorned with a pointed cap
of the same colour, after the manner of the priests of Isis,
or the Chaldean sages, known under the name of Magi.
He carried a little ring in his hand.</p>

<p>‘This mysterious man only said these words to him:
“Approach, young man, and learn the high destinies to
which you are called, if you wish to be prudent and wise.”</p>

<p>‘Immediately, Buonaparte, as if he had been drawn by a
supernatural force, descended from his horse, and followed
him into the interior of the pyramid, where he remained
more than an hour.</p>

<p>‘The officers of his suite, at first, paid little attention to
this <i>rencontre</i>, taking the red man to be one of those charlatans,
with which the world abounds, to the detriment of
science and real knowledge; they were even astonished
that their general, to whom they accorded so much merit,
lost precious time in interviewing a wretched cheat; but,
when they saw Buonaparte come out, all radiant with joy,
saying to them, “Friends, let us give battle; we shall conquer!”
and when they saw, that in spite of the inferiority
of their forces, they should gain the most complete victory,
they could only think of <i>the red man</i>. Is he a God? Is he
a Genius? That was what they asked.</p>

<p>‘Thenceforth the French, in Egypt, only marched from
victory to victory, until the departure of Napoleon for
France.</p>

<p>‘We believe that all the deeds with which <i>the red man</i>
has been credited are only fables which conjecturors have
invented; but, at least, in him they discover the emblem
of a good Genius, who pointed out to Buonaparte what he
ought to do to assure at least the love and gratitude of the
people. But an evil Genius, whom they suppose to have
been clothed in green, appeared to him at St. Cloud, at the
time of the 18th Brumaire, and gave him counsels, which
prevailed, for the misfortune of the world, over those of <i>the
red man</i>, and led him to his ruin.’</p>

<p>Balzac, in a delicious booklet,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> in which an old soldier
gives the history of his beloved Emperor, makes him say,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>‘There is one thing which it would be unjust, if I did not
tell you: In Egypt, in the Desert, near Syria, <span class="smcap">The Red
Man</span> appeared to him, in the mountain of Moses, to tell
him, “All went well.”</p>

<p>‘Then at Marengo, on the evening of the Victory, he
saw, standing before him, the Red Man, who said to him:</p>

<p>‘“Thou shalt see the world at thy feet, and thou shalt
be Emperor of the French, King of Italy, Master of Holland,
Sovereign of Spain, Portugal, the Illyrian Provinces, Protector
of Germany, Saviour of Poland, First Eagle of the
Legion of Honour.”</p>

<p>‘This Red Man, do you see, was his idea, his own: a
kind of lackey, who helped him, as many say, to communicate
with his star. I, myself, have never believed that but
the Red Man is a veritable fact, and Napoleon has spoken
of him himself, and has said that he visits him in troublous
moments, and that he stays at the palace of the Tuileries,
in the upper apartments. Then at his Coronation, Napoleon
saw him, in the evening, for the third time, and they
were in deliberation about many things. Then the Emperor
went straight to Milan to crown himself King of
Italy....</p>

<p>‘At length we found ourselves, one morning, encamped
at Moskowa.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> It was there that I gained the Cross, and I
take the liberty of saying that it was a cursed battle! The
Emperor was uneasy: he had seen the Red Man, who said
to him:</p>

<p>‘“My child, thou art going too fast, men will fail thee,
and friends will betray thee.”’</p>

<p>And the old soldier, almost at the end of his story, says,
‘The remainder is sufficiently well known. The Red Man
passed over to the Bourbons, like a scoundrel, as he is.
France is crushed,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that this legend was known in
England, and was not lost sight of by the satirist.</p>

<p>The English gave Napoleon the character of being very
superstitious, and I believe, even now, ‘Napoleon’s Book of
Fate,’ and ‘Napoleon’s Dream Book,’ are procurable.</p>

<p>In 1795 it is said that Napoleon paid a visit to a
sorcerer named Pierre le Clerc, and expressed some doubt
of his power. ‘You are wrong,’ said the magician, ‘to
doubt my art. I know more than you probably imagine.
There was a prophecy of a certain Count Cagliostro,
uttered ten years ago, on the French Revolution, which was
not then thought of. This announced that a Corsican
voted or elected by the people, would finish it, probably
by a Dictatorship.’ Napoleon left the old man, and, it is
said, did not visit him again until the eve of the fateful
18th Brumaire.</p>

<p>The seer gave him a number of cards, on each of which
he was to write one letter of the question he wanted to
ask, which was: ‘What will become of the Corsican Napoleon
Bonaparte, general, on account of the <i>Coup d’Etat</i>
risked by him, at Paris, the 18th Brumaire, 1799?’ These
cards were well mixed and handed to the conjurer, who,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
after some manipulation, settled on thirteen cards, having
the letters B, O, P, P, I, A, I, B, I, P, A, U, F, each of
which letters he interpreted as the commencement of a
Latin word; and, on this basis, he constructed the following
sentence: ‘Bis Oriens, Populi Princeps, In Altum Incedit;
Bis Incidit; Per Anglos Ultima Fata,’&mdash;or, He rises twice
Prince of the People, and hovers over the heights; twice
he falls; his last fatality will come from the English.</p>

<p>Napoleon then took fresh cards, and wrote: ‘Josephine
Marie Rose de Tascher de la Pagerie, wife of the General
Napoleon Bonaparte.’ Of these Pierre le Clerc selected
three letters, H, E, A, which he interpreted as ‘Herois
Extinctus Amor,’&mdash;or, Love extinguishes itself in the heart
of a hero.</p>

<p>There was a curious article in the ‘Frankfurter Journal’
of September 21, 1870, on the influence of the letter M on
the life of Napoleon: ‘Marbeuf was the first to recognise
the genius of Napoleon at the Military College. Marengo
was the first great battle won by General Bonaparte, and
Melas made room for him in Italy. Mortier was one of
his best generals, Moreau betrayed him, and Marat was the
first martyr to his cause. Maria Louisa shared his highest
fortunes; Moscow was the abyss of ruin into which he fell.
Metternich vanquished him in the field of diplomacy. Six
marshals (Massena, Mortier, Marmont, Macdonald, Murat,
Moncey) and twenty-six generals of division under Napoleon
had the letter M for their initial. Marat, Duke of
Bassano, was his most trusted counsellor. His first battle
was that of Montenotte, his last Mont St. Jean, as the
French term Waterloo. He won the battles of Millesimo,
Mondovi, Montmirail, and Montereau; then came the
storming of Montmartre. Milan was the first enemy’s
capital, and Moscow the last, into which he entered victorious.
He lost Egypt through Menou, and employed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Miellis to take Pius VII. prisoner. Mallet conspired against
him; Murat was the first to desert him, then Marmont.
Three of his ministers were Maret, Montalivet, and Mallieu;
his first chamberlain was Montesquieu. His last halting
place in France was Malmaison. He surrendered to Captain
Maitland of the <i>Bellerophon</i>, and his companions at St.
Helena were Montholon and his valet Marchand.’</p>

<p>NAPOLEON AGAIN TAKES THE FIELD&mdash;HIS DEFEATS&mdash;THE ALLIES AT
PARIS&mdash;NAPOLEON ABDICATES&mdash;HIS ATTEMPT TO POISON HIMSELF.</p></blockquote>

<p>On January 1, 1814, Rowlandson published ‘The double
humbug, or the Devil’s Imp praying for peace,’ a picture in
two parts. One represents Napoleon addressing the Senate
from his throne, which stands on divers crowns: his friend,
the Devil, being perched a-top. A soporific effect among
his audience seems to be the outcome of his address, which
is as follows: ‘<i>Extracts of Bonyparty’s Speech, Sunday,
19 December, 1813.</i> Senators, Counsellors of State, Deputies
from the Department to the Legislative Body. Splendid
Victories have raised the Glory of the French Arms,
during the Campaign. In these weighty circumstances, it
was my first thought to call you around me. I have never
been seduced by prosperity. I have conceived and executed
great designs for the Prosperity and the happiness of
the world, as a monarch and a father. I feel that Peace
adds to the security of Thrones and that of Families. I
have accepted proposals, and the preliminaries. It is necessary
to recruit my armies by numerous Levies, and an
increase of Taxes becomes indispensable&mdash;I am satisfied
with the sentiment of my people of Italy, Denmark, Naples,
America, and the nineteen Swiss cantons; and have acknowledged
the laws which England has, in vain, sought,
during four centuries, to impose on France&mdash;I have ordered
discharges of Artillery on my coming and leaving you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
The other portion of the picture shows the powers of
Europe, before whom Napoleon kneels, surrendering
colours and crowns; all, save one of the latter (the French
crown), and this he tucks under his arm. His deportment
is abject, as is his speech: ‘Gentlemen, Emperors, Kings,
Rhenish Confederations, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Behold unto you a
fallen Impostor, who has for many years been drunk, and
intoxicated, with Ambition, Arrogance, and Insolence, who
has foolishly and wickedly lost within a twelve Months, a
Million of brave but deluded Frenchmen. Who has conceived
the great and diabolical design of enslaving the
world, and has lost all his friends except Yankee Maddison.
Now, Gentlemen, to make amends for my sins, I solicit
your pardon, and ask for Peace, on your own Terms, Gentlemen,
and I will strictly adhere to all ******** You
may take all those Crowns back again, except the one belonging
to the Bourbons. My Empress sends you also back
the 20 flags I found in some of the Churches, in the course
of my flight from Leipsig. As for the story, Gentlemen,
of the Corporal and the blowing up the bridge, you must
know ’twas a mere Humbug to gull the Lads of Paris.’
Talleyrand also assures the crowned heads, that ‘What my
Master has said is true, so help me G&mdash;d. Amen.’</p>

<p>On January 21, 1814, Napoleon once more set out from
Paris at the head of an army, and in this month he fought
at Saint-Dizier, Brienne, Champ-Aubert, Montmirail,
Chateau-Thierry-Nangis, and Montereau, but then the
French arms were almost everywhere defeated. People
could discern the beginning of the end. Meanwhile the
caricaturist was busy.</p>

<p>‘The Devil’s Darling’ is another by Rowlandson
(March 12, 1814); but it possesses no merit, except the
very excellent likeness of Napoleon. He is in swaddling
clothes, and being dandled by the arch-fiend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Wm. Elmes (the ‘W.&nbsp;E.’ of occasional caricatures) drew
(March 21, 1814) ‘John Bull bringing Boney’s nose to the
Grindstone’; but it is not a new subject, as there is a
contemporary caricature of the Scots bringing Charles the
Second’s nose to the grindstone. Russia is turning the stone&mdash;the
allied Powers looking on&mdash;and John Bull, who is performing
the operation, says: ‘Aye, Aye, Master Boney, I
thought I should bring you to it one of these days. You
have carried on the trade of grinding long enough, to the
annoyance of your oppressed neighbours&mdash;One good turn
deserves another&mdash;Give him a Turn brother Alexander&mdash;and
let us see how he likes a taste.’</p>

  <div class="caption">THE DEVIL’S DARLING.</div></div>

<p>‘The Allied Bakers, or the Corsican Toad in the hole’
(April 1, 1814), is taken bodily from a French caricature,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
‘Le Tour des Alliés, ou le Corse près à être cuit,’ although
it bears on it ‘<i>G.&nbsp;H. inv<sup>t</sup> Cruickshank fecit</i>.’ The King of
Prussia, Woronzow, and Blücher have a baker’s peel, on
which is a dish containing Boney, screaming, ‘Murder,
Murder,’ as he is being put into the Allied Oven. Holland
sits on the floor blowing the fire. A Frenchman, whose
fickleness is shown by the weather-cock on his hat, is
opening the oven door for his former master’s destruction,
saying: ‘This door sticks! I don’t think I shall get it
open!’ Blücher shouts, ‘Pull away Frank,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> you keep us
waiting.’ Woronzow says, ‘In with it, Blucher,’ and the
King of Prussia’s opinion is, ‘I tell you what, Woronzow,
the Hinges want a little Russia Oil.’ Wellington, who is
bearing a tray on which is a Soult pie and a Bordeaux pie,
shouts out, ‘Shove altogether, Gentlemen! D&mdash;n me,
shove door and all in.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the allied Austrian, Russian, and Prussian
troops had marched on to Paris, and, having defeated
Marmont, March 30, 1814, the city was virtually at their
mercy. Maria Louisa and the young King of Rome left
Paris on March 29, and on the 31st the city capitulated,
and the Emperor of Russia and the King of Prussia
entered the city with the allied armies. The Emperor of
Austria did not join them, probably out of deference to
his paternal feelings. The ‘Times’ of April 6, 1814, thus
gives the news of the capitulation:&mdash;‘Babylon the great is
fallen! Paris, the proud city, the city of philosophy, has
bowed her neck to the Conqueror.’</p>

<p>‘Boney forsaken by his Guardian Angel’ (April 3,
1814) shows the Emperor kneeling, one crown already
having been taken from him by the arch-fiend, who now is
taking another from off his head. The flames of hell are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
prominent in the distance. Bonaparte implores&mdash;‘My
Guardian Angel, my Protector, do not desert me in the
hour of Danger.’ But the Devil, exultant, says, ‘Poh!
Poh! you cannot expect to reign for ever; besides I want
you at home, to teach some of the young Imps wickedness.’</p>

<p>On April 3 the fickle French destroyed their idol, for
the Provisional Government declared Napoleon deposed,
and his dynasty abolished.</p>

<p>On April 5 Bonaparte formally abdicated the throne of
France; and, when we consider how long he had troubled
the peace of this country, we can pardon the almost brutal
exultation of the ‘Times’ of April 11:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘The most hateful of Tyrants has finished by proving
himself the most infamous of cowards.</p>

<p>‘Two <i>Extraordinary Gazettes</i> were published on Saturday;
the latter of which contained <span class="smcap">Buonaparte’s</span> renunciation
of sovereignty, in the following <span class="locked">terms:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Allied Powers having proclaimed that the Emperor <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
was the only obstacle to the re-establishment of the peace
of Europe, the Emperor <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, <i>faithful to his oath</i>, declares
that he renounces for himself and his heirs, the Thrones of France
and Italy; and that there is no <i>personal sacrifice</i>, even that of his
life, which he is not ready to make in the interest of France.</p>

<p class="sigright">
Done at the Palace of Fontainebleau the &mdash;&mdash; April, 1814.
</p></blockquote>

<p>‘Thus has the last act of this wretch’s public life been
marked by the same loathsome hypocrisy which characterised
him throughout his guilty career. When he has
been solemnly deposed by his own confederates; when the
execrations of all France, and of all Europe, are ringing in
his ears; when his last army is deserting him by thousands,
and an overwhelming force of the Allies is approaching,
to drag him to a shameful death, if he refuses the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
proffer’d mercy&mdash;then, forsooth, his forced submission is a
voluntary sacrifice, he is actuated by a principle of public
spirit, he feels a religious regard for his oath!!!</p>

<p>‘We did not think to have troubled our heads what
should become of him, or his worthless carcase&mdash;whether
he should crawl about upon the face of that earth, which
he had so long desolated; or end a miserable existence by
his own desperate hand; or be helped out of the world by
the guillotine, the halter, or the <i>coup de grâce</i>. Certainly,
if we had to choose the finest moral lesson for after ages,
we could not have preferred any to that, which should at
once expose the selfishness, the baseness, and the cowardice
of a vainglorious mortal, whom adulation has raised almost
to divine honours. And, as to any danger from his life&mdash;why,
<i>Jerry Sneak</i> was a hero to him. Twice before, had
he run away from the field of battle&mdash;but that, in the

<p>‘The abandonment of his throne was an act of undisguised,
deliberate cowardice, not altogether unanticipated
by us; for it will be remembered that some months ago,
in comparing the terms offered to him by the Allies, with
<i>Fluellen’s</i> offer of the leek to ancient <i>Pistol</i>, we said, that
though he might vow “most horrible revenge,” he would
eat the leek. We had not then any reason to believe that
he would be required to yield up crown and all; but now
that circumstances have led to such a point, his conduct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
in respect to it occasions us no surprise. That which
displeases us, however, is, that in the very document which
ought to have contained nothing more than his subscription
to his own disgrace, he has been allowed to lay claim
to something like honour&mdash;to shuffle in a lying pretence to
virtue. This was not a time to indulge his vanity. The
record of his punishment ought rather to have referred to
real crimes than to fictitious merits.’</p>

<p>The illuminations on this occasion were very splendid&mdash;but
perhaps the best of them all, as illustrating the popular
feeling, was one which was simply ‘Thank God.’</p>

<p>The following caricature must have been published
before the news of the abdication reached England.</p>

  <div class="caption">NAPOLEON SIGNING HIS ABDICATION.</div></div>

<p>The scene, however, was not quite as the poet makes it
out, but it was bad enough, if we may credit Madame
Junot: ‘We have read of the revolutions of the seraglio:
of those of the Lower Empire: of the assassinations of
Russia; we have seen the blood-stained crowns of India
given to vile eunuchs; but nothing in the pages of history
presents any parallel to what passed at Fontainebleau
during the days, and above all the nights, passed
there by the hero, abandoned by fortune, and surrounded
by those whom he supposed to be his friends. A thick
veil was drawn over the event, for the principal actors in it
carefully concealed their baseness from the eye of the
world. Few persons are aware that Napoleon was doomed
to death during the few days which preceded his abdication,
by a band of conspirators composed of the most distinguished
chiefs of the army.</p>

<p>‘“But,” said one of them in the council in which these
demons discussed their atrocious project, “what are we to
do with him? There are two or three among us, who, like
Antony,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> would exhibit their blood stained robes to the
people, and make us play the part of Cassius and Brutus.
I have no wish to see my house burned, and to be sent
into exile.” “Well,” said another, “we must leave no
trace of him. He must be sent to heaven like Romulus.”
The others applauded, and then a most horrible discussion
commenced. It is not in my power to relate the details.
Suffice it to say that the Emperor’s death was proposed
and discussed for the space of an hour, with a degree of
coolness which might be expected among Indian savages
armed with tomahawks. “But,” said he who had spoken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
first, “we must come to some determination. The Emperor
of Russia is impatient. The month of April is
advancing, and nothing has been done. Now, for the last
time, we will speak to him of his abdication. He must
sign it definitely&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;” A horrible gesture followed the
last word.</p>

<p>‘Yes, the life of Napoleon was threatened by those
very men whom he had loaded with wealth, honours, and
favours; to whom he had given lustre from this reflection
of his own glory. Napoleon was warned of the conspiracy,
and it must have been the most agonising event of his
whole life. The torments of St. Helena were nothing in
comparison with what he must have suffered when a pen
was presented to him by a man who presumed to say,
“Sign&mdash;if you wish to live.” If these last words were not
articulated, the look, the gesture, the inflection of the voice,
expressed more than the tongue could have uttered.’</p>

<p>How these rats left the falling house!&mdash;Berthier, with a
lie on his lips, promising to return, yet knowing full well he
never meant to; Constant, his valet, running away with
100,000 francs, and burying them in the forest of Fontainebleau;
and Rustan, the <i>faithful</i> Mameluke, running away
to Paris. Is it not a sickening sight to see these pitiful
rogues deserting their master?</p>

<p>On April 11 the treaty of abdication was signed by the
allies, and by it Napoleon was to keep his title of Emperor,
and have the sovereignty of the Island of Elba, where,
however, he must permanently reside. He was guaranteed
a revenue of 6,000,000 francs. Josephine and the other
members of the Emperor’s family were to have 2,000,000
francs divided amongst them; and Maria Louisa and the
King of Rome were to have the Duchies of Parma,
Placentia, and Guastalla.</p>

<p>But, when all was finished, he felt his position too hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
to bear. He would have recalled his abdication&mdash;but it was
too late. Tom from his high estate, separated from his
wife and child, deserted by the creatures of his bounty, life
was not worth living for; existence was wretched, and he
tried to put an end to it by poison on the night of April
12. Baron Fain, in ‘The Manuscript of 1814,’ gives a
good account of this occurrence, but not nearly as graphic
as does Madame <span class="locked">Junot:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘Throughout the day his conversation turned on subjects
of the most gloomy kind, and he dwelt much on
suicide. He spoke so frequently on the subject, that
Marchand,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> his first <i>valet de chambre</i>, and Constant were
struck with it. They consulted together, and both, with
common consent, removed from the Emperor’s chamber
an Arabian poniard, and the balls from his pistol-case.
The Duke of Bassano had also remarked this continued
allusion to suicide, notwithstanding his efforts to divert
Napoleon’s thoughts from it. The Duke spoke to Marchand,
after he had taken leave of the Emperor, previous
to retiring to rest, and he expressed himself satisfied with
the precautions which had been taken. The Duke had
been in bed some time, when he was awoke by Constant,
who came to him pale and trembling: “Monsieur le Duc,”
he exclaimed, “come immediately to the Emperor. His
Majesty has been taken very ill!” The Duke of Bassano
immediately hurried to the bedside of the Emperor, whom
he found pale and cold as a marble statue. He had taken
poison!</p>

<p>‘When Napoleon departed for his second campaign in
Russia, Corvisart gave him some poison of so subtle a
nature, that in a few minutes, even in a few seconds, it
would produce death. This poison was the same as that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
treated of by Cabanis, and consisted of the prussic acid
which has subsequently been ascertained to be so fatal in
its effects. It was with this same poison that Condorcet
terminated his existence. Napoleon constantly carried it
about him. It was enclosed in a little bag hermetically
sealed, and suspended round his neck. As he always wore
a flannel waistcoat next his skin, the little bag had for a
long time escaped the observation of Marchand, and he
had forgotten it. Napoleon was confident in the efficacy
of this poison, and regarded it as the means of being
master of himself. He swallowed it on the night above
mentioned, after having put his affairs in order and written
some letters. He had tacitly bade farewell to the Duke of
Bassano and some of his other friends, but without giving
them cause for the slightest suspicion.</p>

<p>‘The poison was, as I have already observed, extremely
violent in its nature; but, by reason of its subtlety, it was
the more liable to lose its power by being kept for any
length of time. This happened in the present instance.
It caused the Emperor dreadful pain, but it did not prove
fatal. When the Duke of Bassano perceived him in a
condition closely resembling death, he knelt down at his
bedside and burst into tears: “Ah! Sire!” he exclaimed,
“what have you done?” The Emperor raised his eyes and
looked at the Duke with an expression of kindness; then,
stretching to him his cold and humid hand, he said: “You
see, God has decreed that I shall not die. He, too, condemns
me to suffer!”’</p>

<span class="subhead">NAPOLEON LEAVES FOR ELBA&mdash;HIS RECEPTION THERE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>After a sad parting with his old guard at Fontainebleau,
on April 20, Napoleon left for Elba, embarking on board
an English frigate on the 28th. We can now resume the
caricatures.</p>

<p>Rowlandson produced (April 12, 1814) ‘Bloody Boney,
the Carcass Butcher; left off Trade and retiring to Scarecrow
Island.’ Napoleon and the Empress, together with a
bag of brown bread, are mounted on a donkey&mdash;he wears
a fool’s cap, and she belabours the ass with a ‘Baton
Marechale’; the young King of Rome precedes them on
a Corsican dog. The usual direction-post (a gallows)
shows the road to Elba, and ravens are hankering after
him, saying, ‘We long to pick your bones.’ A heavy-booted
postilion is calling out, ‘Be Gar, you Cocquin,
now I shall drive my old Friends and bonne customers de
English. Vive le Roi et le Poste Royale.’</p>

<p>Rowlandson plagiarised Gillray by almost slavishly
copying ‘Death of the Corsican Fox’ (<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/50184/50184-h/50184-h.htm#Page_204">Vol. I. p. 204</a>), only
he substituted Blücher for George the Third, and changed
the names on the dogs’ collars to <i>Wellington</i>, <i>Swartzenberg</i>,
Kutusoff, Duke of York, and Crown Prince. This etching
is called ‘Coming in at the death of the Corsican fox.
Scene the Last’ (April 12, 1814).</p>

<p>‘A Grand Manœuvre! or, the Rogues march to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Island of Elba,’ G. Cruikshank (April 13, 1814). Here
Napoleon is shewn weeping bitterly at his own disgrace.
His hands are bound behind him, his tattered uniform is
put on wrong side in front, his boots have no soles nor
toes, and his spurs are strapped in front; some <i>gamins</i> are
tugging at a halter which is round his neck, and are
dragging him to a boat, in which sits the Devil, waiting for
him; Talleyrand is doing all in his power to expedite
matters by pushing him behind with an ‘Allied broom,’
and he goes to his doom amidst universal execrations. The
little King of Rome is in one of his coat-tail pockets, and
calls out, ‘By Gar, Papa, I have von <i>grand manœuvre</i> in
your pocket.’</p>

a portion of which is reproduced. Blücher is dragging
Napoleon and his brother, who are handcuffed, and on a
placard which he bears on his shoulder is inscribed ‘Napoleon,
late Emperor of the French, King of Italy, Protector
of the Confederation of the Rhine, Grand Arbiter
of the fate of Nations, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., but now, by the permission
of the Allied Sovereigns, Exile in the Isle of Elba,
an outcast from Society, a fugitive, a vagabond. Yet this
is the conceited mortal who said, I have never been seduced
by prosperity&mdash;Adversity will not be able to overcome
me.’ In the background drummers are playing ‘The
Rogue’s March,’ and all the European Powers dancing
round the old Bourbon flag, on which is written ‘Rejoice
O ye Kings, Vive le Roi!’</p>

<p>‘The Sorrows of Boney, or Meditations in the Island
of Elba!!!’ (April 15, 1814) shews the disconsolate Emperor,
seated on the rocky isle, weeping copiously, and
staring anxiously at the Continent of Europe which is so
well guarded by ships. This engraving did former duty
as ‘Crocodile’s tears’ (see <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/50184/50184-h/50184-h.htm#Page_241">Vol. I. p. 241</a>).</p>

<p>On April 17, 1814, Rowlandson published ‘The Affectionate
farewell, or kick for kick,’ which gives us Talleyrand
kicking Napoleon and striking him with his crutch. ‘Va
t’en Coquin, I’ll crack your Crown, you pitiful vagabond.’
The fallen Emperor not only puts up with these insults,
but, turning round, says, ‘Votre très humble serviteur, Monsieur
Tally.’ His maimed soldiery call out, ‘Bone him,
my tight little Tally,’ and one even goes so far as to shout
out, ‘What! let him sneak off without a mark or a scratch!
No, no, I’ll darken his daylights for him.’</p>

<p>‘The Last March of the Conscripts, or Satan and his
Satellites hurled to the land of oblivion’ (April 17, 1814),
represents Napoleon and his brothers all chained together
in a gang, heavily fettered, in tatters, and being whipped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
by a most ferocious Cossack. To add to poor Boney’s
miseries, his little child is pulling at his coat-tails crying,
‘Didn’t you promise me I should be a King?’ Talleyrand
is rejoicing, and a large box of crowns and sceptres is
labelled, ‘To the right owners.’</p>

<p>‘A delicate finish to a French Usurper’ is by T.&nbsp;N.
(April 20, 1814), although Mr. Grego places it as one of
Rowlandson’s&mdash;who possibly may have etched it.</p>

<p>This represents Bonaparte, seated on a throne of skulls
and bones, very ill indeed. His crown of tyranny has
fallen off and is broken, and he is in the act of disgorging
‘The Throne of France,’ having already done so with
Holland, Rome, Portugal, &amp;c.&mdash;in fact, all his previous
successes: nay, the very bees are flying away from off his
imperial mantle. Time is putting an extinguisher on his
head; whilst the Duke of Wellington, the Emperor Alexander,
he of Austria, and the Crown Prince, stand looking
at Blücher, who is administering his ‘black draught’ to
the patient. Three dancing females&mdash;two of them holding
a shield charged with the Bourbon lilies over the head of

Cossack. Others surround and guard him, and we can
well understand the captive’s ejaculatory ‘Oh&mdash;d&mdash;n these
Cossacks.’</p>

<p>‘Nap dreading his doleful Doom or his grand entry
into the Isle of Elba’ (April 25, 1814), represents the
exiled Emperor at the moment of his landing. He has
just been put ashore in a small boat, and his slender
luggage, which is guarded by his solitary follower, a
Mameluke, is deposited on the shore. With one hand in
the breast of his coat, and the other thrust deep into his
breeches pocket, suffering, too, from the impertinent inquisitiveness
of the natives, it is no wonder that he appears
downcast, and says, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>‘Ah, Woe is me, seeing what I have, and
seeing what I see.’ He is, however, tried to be comforted
by a blowsy bumboat woman, who, offering him her long
clay pipe, pats him on the back with ‘Come cheer up my
little Nicky, I’ll be your Empress.’</p>

<p>George Cruikshank (May 1, 1814) gives us ‘Snuffing
out Boney,’ an operation which is being performed by a
gigantic Cossack.</p>

<p>Hardly a caricature, is a picture attributed to Rowlandson
(May 1, 1814), in which is depicted Napoleon’s throne
overturned, together with his crown and sceptre. The
Devil himself is clutching Napoleon, who is terrified at the
heavenly apparition of a hand holding a flaming sword,
and the legend, ‘Thou ’rt doom’d to Pain, at which the
Damn’d will tremble, and take their own for Joys.’ This
etching is called <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>‘The Tyrant of the Continent is fallen.

<p>In the ‘Satirist’ of May 1, 1814, is a picture by G.
Cruikshank, called ‘<i>Otium cum dignitate</i>, or a view of
Elba.’ It is not a good one. Napoleon, ragged and
stockingless, smoking a short clay pipe, is blowing up the
fire with a pair of bellows. Bertrand is kissing a female,
probably Pauline, on the sly, and Jerome Bonaparte is
mending nets.</p>

<p>‘Needs must when Wellington Drives, or Louis’s
Return!!’ (May 1814) is a very badly drawn picture by
Marks. Louis the Eighteenth, unable to walk, by reason
of the gout, is being drawn along in a sort of Bath chair
by Napoleon, and attended on either side by Blücher and
Wellington. The latter is punishing poor Napoleon with
a birch-rod, saying meanwhile, ‘I desire, you will sing
God save the King.’ Boney, with his handkerchief to his
eyes, says, ‘I’ll be d&mdash;d if I do.’ Blücher is of opinion,
‘You’l be d&mdash;d whether you do or not.’</p>

<p>A very commonplace caricature is ‘The Tyrant, overtaken
by Justice, is excluded from the world,’ and it would
not be noticed here did it not introduce us to a new artist,
L.&nbsp;M. (? Lewis Marks). Napoleon, chained to his rock,
disconsolately gazes at that world which he may not reach,
the Devil meanwhile pointing the finger of scorn at him
(May 1814).</p>

and says, ‘Dear Talley, persuade them to leave us a few of
these pretty things for my <i>chambers</i>, they will pacify the
Deputies, and amuse the people.’ Talleyrand replies, ‘I
have tried every scheme to retain them, but it seems they
have <i>at last</i> found us out, and are not to be humbug’d any

<p>On June 4, 1814, was published (artist unknown) ‘An
Imperial vomit’ in which Bonaparte is disgorging the
kingdoms he has swallowed up. The Prince Regent, behind
him, says, ‘I think now my little fellow, you are
pretty well clear’d out, and I hope you will never give us
the trouble to Prescribe or Proscribe any more.’</p>

<p>‘Drumming out of the French Army!!!’ is the title of
a picture published in June 1814. Blücher has Bonaparte
in a drum, which he carries before him, beating him alternately
with a birch-rod and a drum-stick, Russia, Prussia,
and Austria looking on.</p>

<p>Lewis Marks produced, in June 1814, ‘Boney and his
new subjects at Elba.’ The poverty-stricken condition to
which the Emperor is reduced is too graphically portrayed,
and his ragged army of four is very vividly illustrated.
He thus addresses them: ‘Gentlemen, my friends despise
and d&mdash;n England, Russia, Prussia, Germany, and Sweden,
and obey me&mdash;and I will make kings of you all.’</p>

<p>Napoleon might well say that his ‘territory was somewhat
small;’ but, small as it was, his restless activity set to
work to improve it. He made roads where none had
existed, canals and aqueducts, a lazaretto, and stations for
tunny-fishing. Vineyards were improved, and the little
island was quite prosperous. Numerous visitors came to
pay their respects to the Emperor, causing money to be
spent; vessels brought provisions, and took away what the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
inhabitants had to export. Porto Ferrajo was gay and
lively, its name being changed to Cosmopoli. A new flag
was manufactured, having a red bend dexter, charged with
three bees on a white field, and Moorish pirates were very
chary of touching vessels bearing this flag. In May Cambrone
brought out some volunteers of the old guard, and
Napoleon exercised and inspected his little army.</p>

  <div class="caption">BONEY AND HIS NEW SUBJECTS AT ELBA (<i>see previous page</i>).</div></div>

<p>But these things cost money, and that was one of the
things wanting to Napoleon. The conditions of the treaty
with him were shamefully broken. Hear what he says
himself about it:<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>‘It was stipulated and agreed to, that
all the members of my family should be allowed to follow
me to Elba; but, in violation of that, my wife and child
were seized, detained, and never permitted to join a husband
and a father. They were also to have had the
Duchies of Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla, which they were
deprived of. By the treaty, Prince Eugene was to have had
a principality in Italy, which was never given. My mother
and brothers were to receive pensions, which were also
refused to them. My own private property, and the
savings which I had made on the civil list, were to have
been preserved for me. Instead of that, they were seized
in the hands of Labouillerie the treasurer, contrary to the
treaty, and all claims made by me rejected. The private
property of my family was to be held sacred: it was confiscated.
The dotations assigned to the army on the Mont
Napoleon were to be preserved: they were suppressed;
nor were the hundred thousand francs which were to be
given as pensions to persons pointed out by me, ever paid.
Moreover, assassins were sent to Elba to murder me.
Never,’ continued Napoleon, ‘have the terms of a treaty
been more evidently violated, and indeed openly scoffed
at, than those were by the allies.’</p>

<p>Louis the Eighteenth was very tame after Napoleon, who,
in spite of his draining France of men and treasure, had
implanted a deep personal love for him in the hearts of his
people; and, from some fancied saying of his, that ‘he would
return in the spring,’ the violet, the flower of spring, was taken
as his emblem, and so worn. He was spoken of under the
name of Caporal Violette, or Papa Violette, and the people
comforted themselves with ‘En printemps il reviendra.’</p>

<p>There were several coloured engravings of bunches of
violets, bearing the portraits of Napoleon, Maria Louisa,
and the King of Rome&mdash;or Prince of Parma, as he was then
called&mdash;published in France; notably one by Cann, ‘Violettes
du 20 Mars 1815,’ from which, in all probability,
Cruikshank took his caricature of <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>‘The Peddigree of
Corporal Violet (G.&nbsp;H. inv<sup>t</sup> et del. etched by G. Cruikshank
9 June 1815)’; but, in the arrangement of the flowers,
it is superior to any of the French pictures that I have
seen.</p>

  <img src="images/i_210.jpg" width="313" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE PEDDIGREE OF CORPORAL VIOLET.</div></div>

<p>For want of space, I have but partially reproduced it.
It is described ‘First as a Consular Toad Stool, rising from
a Corsican Dunghill, then changing to an Imperial Sun
Flower, from that to an Elba fungus’ (where the illustration
commences), ‘and lastly to a bunch of Violets, which
are so disposed as to represent a <i>whole length Profile of
Buonaparte</i>, with a bust of <i>Maria Louisa</i>, and her Son, the
<i>Prince of Parma</i>,’ which portraits, undoubtedly existing in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
the picture, will be a pleasing exercise of patience on the
part of my readers to discover.</p>

<p>Although not English caricature, I may be pardoned
for giving, as a type of then French feeling, a song sung
by the troops amongst themselves. It is full of slang of
the period, which the notes will <span class="locked">elucidate:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>During Napoleon’s exile Josephine had died, on May
29. She had lived quite long enough, and had experienced
as many, and as great, vicissitudes as any woman.</p>

<p>In June the Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia
and his sons, with a numerous suite, visited London, and
were made LL.D.’s at Oxford, great fun being made at the
time about conferring the degree on Blücher, <i>Dr.</i> Blücher
figuring in many caricatures.</p>

<p>‘John Bull mad with Joy! or the First of August 1814,’
shows the old fellow in ecstasies of delight. He has thrown
away his hat, and is waving his wig, dancing all the time.
The Prince Regent says, ‘Ah, ha! Johnny, I knew you’d
be delighted,’ and shows him the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>‘Bill of Fare of the Grand
National Jubilee for the Peace of 1814. Hyde Park&mdash;A
grand fair&mdash;Mess<sup>rs</sup> Gyngall, Richardson, and Punches
shows&mdash;a grand sea fight upon the Serpentine&mdash;Fireworks
in Kensington Gardens&mdash;plenty of gin and beer&mdash;St.
James’ Park&mdash;a Balloon&mdash;Chinese bridge and Pagoda&mdash;Boat
race on the Canal&mdash;fireworks&mdash;plenty of port, sherry,
claret, champagne, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Green Park&mdash;Castle and
Temple&mdash;Fireworks and Royal Booths.’ In his right hand
the capering and joyous John swings a miniature gallows,
on which hang the prince’s enemies, and he cries out in his
joy, ‘Huzza for the Prince of Princes! Damn the lying
London Papers! May Whitbread be drown’d in one of
his own butts! and Tierney be choked with his long
speeches. Here I have your enemies as they should be!
I shall stick this in my Corn field to frighten the Crows!
so Huzza, again and again, for the Prince of Princes.’</p>

<p>This was the outcome of the Grand Jubilee on August 1,
which was celebrated in London&mdash;notably in the parks.
‘Mad with joy’ was the proper expression. See what this
peace meant for the nation&mdash;a revival of trade, a remission
of taxes, cheaper provisions, the reuniting to their families
of beloved ones who had undergone so much for their
country. No one can wonder that the people went ‘mad
with joy,’ and were not ashamed to confess it. There was
a pagoda on a Chinese<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> bridge thrown over the canal in
St. James’s Park, and at night fireworks were displayed
thereon. Chinese lanterns all along the Mall and Birdcage
Walk. In the Green Park was a ‘Temple of Concord,’
near which was a fine booth for the accommodation
of the foreign ambassadors and guests whom the Regent
delighted to honour. Small men-of-war waged a mimic
sea-fight on the Serpentine, and in Hyde Park was a regular
fair. Sadler went up in his balloon, but nearly came to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
grief, and descended somewhat precipitately in Mucking
Marshes, on the Essex coast, sixteen miles below Gravesend.
Sad to say, about midnight the pagoda caught fire,
and two people lost their lives. The fair in Hyde Park
was kept going for several days afterwards.</p>

<p>So we leave the year 1814, with Napoleon seemingly
safe, yet far from contented, and the English people revelling
in the new and welcome blessings of peace.</p>

<p>NAPOLEON’S ESCAPE FROM ELBA&mdash;UNIVERSAL CONSTERNATION&mdash;FLIGHT
OF THE BRITISH FROM FRANCE&mdash;CARICATURES ON HIS RETURN.</p></blockquote>

<p>A somewhat elaborate caricature is by George Cruikshank
(January 1815), and is entitled ‘Twelfth Night, or What
you Will! now performing at the Theatre Royal Europe,
with new Scenery, decorations, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.’ It represents
a theatre, on the stage of which sit Wellington, Austria,
Russia, and Prussia. The former has been dividing an
enormous Twelfth Cake, with the help of a huge knife and
Britannia’s trident. Austria simply takes the whole of
Germany, and remarks, ‘I shall get my piece cut as
large as I can. I don’t think it is large enough.’ Russia,
who is not content with his huge piece of Russia in
Europe, puts his hand on Poland, and, turning to a Pole,
who is drawing his sword, says: ‘Here brother, take possession
of this piece, I think I can manage them both;
besides, this has more plumbs on it, which will mix with
mine.’ Prussia, besides his own country, lays hands on
Saxony, exclaiming: ‘If I add this Saxon piece to my
Prussian one, and put the figure of an Emperor on it, I
think my share will look respectable.’ Wellington, however,
reflects, ‘I have been assisting to divide the Cake,
but I don’t much like my office, the Gentlemen seem so
dissatisfied.’ Bernadotte comforts himself with ‘Now
I have got Norway, I can get a wind to blow which way I
please.’ Louis the Eighteenth and a Dutchman are in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
private box; and in one of the stage-boxes is John Bull
and his dog, the former of whom shakes hands with and welcomes
an American Indian, saying, ‘I hope you won’t disturb
the peace.’ In the opposite box are two Turks and a
Hungarian; whilst in the box above is Spain, his crown stuck
all over with gallows, and attended by a fearful-looking
Jesuit, reading from a ‘list of Prisoners to be hung for supporting
a free Constitution.’ The other Powers are on
their knees on the stage, abjectly begging, ‘Pray, Gentlemen,
spare us a few of the small pieces, for we are almost
starving.’</p>

<p>Napoleon was still at Elba, and Europe was enjoying
a fool’s paradise, as cannot be better shown than by a quotation
from Rogers’s ‘Recollections’ (if reliable): ‘When
Buonaparte left Elba for France, I (the Duke of Wellington)
was at Vienna, and received the news from Lord Burghersh,
our Minister at Florence. The instant it came, I communicated
it to every member of the Congress, and all
laughed; the Emperor of Russia most of all.’</p>

<p>Doubtless they thought themselves secure, for they left
Elba unguarded in the most singular manner. As Napoleon
told O’Meara: ‘I do not believe that Castlereagh
thought I should have ventured to leave Elba, as otherwise
some frigates would have been stationed about the island.
If they had kept a frigate in the harbour, and another outside,
it would have been impossible for me to have gone to
France, except alone, which I would never have attempted.
Even if the King of France had ordered a frigate, with a
picked crew, to cruise off the island, it would have prevented
me.’</p>

<p>Napoleon did not leave Elba till February 26, nor did
he land at Cannes till March 1, when the news of his landing
spread like wildfire. The ‘Times’ of March 11 says:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>‘Early yesterday morning we received by express from
Dover, the important, but lamentable intelligence, of a civil
war having been again kindled in France, by that wretch
Buonaparte, whose life was so impoliticly spared by the
Allied Sovereigns. It now appears that the hypocritical
villain, who, at the time of his cowardly abdication, affected
an aversion to the shedding of blood in a civil warfare, has
been employed during the whole time of his residence at
Elba, in carrying on secret and treasonable intrigues with
the tools of his former crimes in France,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>The caricaturists soon fastened on this event, which fell
upon Europe like a thunderbolt, and some time in March
was published ‘The Devil to pay, or Boney’s return from
<span class="strike">Hell Bay</span>Elba, 25 Feb. 1815,’ by I.&nbsp;L. Marks. Napoleon is
crossing the sea in a boat filled with soldiers, rowed by the
Devil, and steered by Death. He sees the dove of peace,
and immediately kills it with his pistol, saying, ‘Away
from my sight, Peace, Thou art hateful to me.’ The Devil
opines, ‘We shall wade through seas of Blood after this;’
and Death, waving a tricoloured flag on his dart, says, ‘A
more expert hand at my Trade does not exist.’ The populace
are running to the shore to meet their returned Emperor
with effusion, whilst poor gouty Louis is being carried
away on pickaback, lamenting, ‘Oh Heartwell,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> I sigh for
thy peacefull Shades.’</p>

<p>I.&nbsp;L. Marks drew ‘1 Mar. 1815. The European Pantomime.
Princeaple Caracters Harliquin Mr. Boney.
Pantaloon Louis XVIII. Columbine Maria Louiza. Clowns
&amp;c. by Congress.’ Here Napoleon is making a terrific leap
from Elba to the French coast, where the poor pantaloon,
all gouty, shakes his crutch in impotent rage. The Empress
and her little son welcome him, and Congress is
represented by the different sovereigns of Europe, who are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
in a tent; Russia pointing to a globe in the midst of
them.</p>

<p>The flight of the British who were in France, upon
hearing the news of Napoleon’s landing, is amusingly
shown in ‘Hell broke loose or the John Bulls made Jack
Asses,’ which is the euphonious title of a caricature by
G. Cruikshank, published March 20, 1815. In it we see depicted
the flight of Louis the Eighteenth and all the English
then resident in Paris. They are departing in fearful haste,
and by all kinds of conveyances. One reflects, ‘How
they will laugh at us at home for being so fond of spending
our Money in Foreign Countries.’ Another complains, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>‘Oh
dear, Oh! dear, I have left all my valuables in Paris. I
wish I had never brought my prosperity into France.’
One man, gouty, is being dragged along in a go-cart.
Three men are mounted on a cow, whilst another holds on
by its tail; whilst those on horseback, or in carriages, are
having their quadrupeds and vehicles requisitioned, ‘Me
vant de horse to meet my old master Boney.’ ‘We want
de coach to join de grand Emperor; we teach you now to
recover our lost honour and fight like devils.’ Napoleon,
at the head of his army, says, ‘Aye, Aye, I shall catch
some of the John Bulls, and I’ll make them spend their
money, and their time, too, in France.’</p>

<p>‘Boney’s Return from Elba, or the Devil among the
Tailors (G.&nbsp;H. inv<sup>t</sup> etched by G. Cruikshank, 21 March,
1815)’ is indeed a scare. Before describing the picture, it
would be as well to read the following lines which are at
its <span class="locked">foot:&mdash;</span></p>

Bonaparte, suddenly leaping from Elba, enters at an
open window, knocking off the board, on which he had been
sitting, the unlucky Louis the Eighteenth, who lies prone on
the floor, crying, ‘Help, help! Oh! I am knocked off my
Perch.’ John Bull goes to his assistance, comforting him
with, ‘Never fear old boy, I’ll help you up again; as for
that rascal Boney, I’ll sew him up presently.’ Boney,
meanwhile, is calmly seated on the tailor’s bench, saying,
‘Dont disturb yourselves, shopmates, I have only popped
myself here as a cutter out. Where is my wife and son,
Father Francis?’ Trembling Austria, goose in one hand,
scissors in the other, says, ‘I will send an answer shortly.’
Terrified Holland exclaims, ‘Donder and Blizen dat is de
Devil!’ Russia, pointing to a knout, says, ‘I’ll take a
few Cossack <i>measures</i> to him.’ Old Blücher, with a huge
pair of shears, advances to Napoleon, exclaiming, ‘Cutter
out indeed!!! Yes, Yes, I’ll cut you out, Master Boney.’
Prussia, still seated, sewing, thinks, ‘You have cut out a
little work for us to be sure, but d&mdash;&mdash; me if you shall be
foreman here.’ Bernadotte opines that ‘This looks like
another subsidy.’ Talleyrand is hiding himself under the
bench; and the poor Pope, sprawling on the floor, forgets
all Christian charity and language, and cries out, ‘Oh! curse
the fellow, I wish I had the power of a <i>Bull</i>, I’d kick him
to <i>Hell</i>. D&mdash;n me if it isn’t enough to make a saint
swear.’</p>

<p>‘A Review of the New Grand Army’ (artist unnamed,
March 1815) shows, in the background, a host of very
tattered troops. In front is Napoleon, <i>the aghast Emperor</i>,
and <i>his two friends and Pillars of the State</i>, Death and the
Devil. On one side of him is a <i>Captain of Starved
Banditti from the Alps</i>, whose aim and object is plunder,
and he acts as aide-de-camp; whilst a ferocious <i>Butcher
from Elba</i>, reeking knife, and halter, in either hand, guards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
his other side, and acts as generalissimo. In a flood of
light over Napoleon’s head appears the <i>Dæmon of War
presiding over the Tyrant</i>, bearing in one hand a flag,
inscribed ‘We come to redress Grievances,’ and with the
other pointing to ‘<i>Boundless Ambition</i>.’</p>

<p>G. Cruikshank etched (April 4, 1815) ‘The Genius of
France expounding her Laws to the Sublime People.’ An
enormous monkey, his tail ornamented with tricoloured
bows, unfolds a tricoloured scroll, which a lot of much
smaller monkeys are reading. It is ‘The French Code of
Laws.&mdash;Ye shall be vain, fickle, and foolish&mdash;Ye shall kill
your King one day, and crown his relative the next.&mdash;You
shall get tired of Him in a few weeks&mdash;and recal a <span class="smcap">Tyrant</span>,
who has made suffering humanity bleed at every
pore&mdash;because it will be truly <i>Nouvelle</i>&mdash;Lastly, ye shall
abolish and destroy all virtuous Society and worship the

<p>‘The Congress dissolved before the <i>Cake</i> was cut’ is
the title of an etching by G. Cruikshank (dated April 6,
1815), in which the sovereigns are seated round an enormous
cake of Europe, which they were going to cut up
and divide, but are startled by the sudden apparition of
Napoleon, who, with drawn sword, strides into the room,
trampling on the <i>decrees of the Congress, An account of the
Deliverance of Europe</i>, and <i>a plan for the security of Europe</i>.
The Dutchman falls off his stool, and spills his bottle of
Hollands: ‘Oh! Donder and Blizen, my Hollands is all
gone,’ is his consolatory reflection. Russia starts up with
‘Who the Devil expected you here,&mdash;this is <i>mal à propos</i>.’
Prussia ‘Thought England had promised to guard him.’
Austria, in terror, yells out for somebody to ‘hold him, seize
him.’ The Pope pathetically laments, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>‘Oh dear, oh dear,
what will become of me?’ Bernadotte shouts, ‘Seize
him, Kill him’; but Poland, with folded arms, calmly asks,
‘Who’ll begin? there’s the Rub!!!’ The only one of the
whole of them who has any presence of mind is Wellington,
who jumps alertly to his feet and draws his sword.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE FLIGHT OF BONAPARTE FROM HELL-BAY.</div></div>

<p>‘The flight of Bonaparte from Hell-Bay’ is by Rowlandson
(April 7, 1815). It represents the arch-fiend,
seated in his own peculiar dominions, engaged in blowing
bubbles, on one of which he has mounted Napoleon, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
sent him once more aloft, to the intense delight of admiring
devils.</p>

<p>Rowlandson etched ‘Hell Hounds rallying round the
Idol of France’ (April 8, 1815), which certainly is not a
pleasant picture. A colossal bust of Napoleon, with a
halter round his neck, is mounted on a pyramid of human
heads, and around him, to testify their delight at his
return, are dancing Savary, Fouché, Caulaincourt, Vandamme,
Davoust, Ney, and Lefèbre. Devils, who say
‘He deserves a crown of pitch,’ are bringing one already
alight. The foreground is strewn with corpses.</p>

<p>‘Vive le Roi! vive l’Empereur! vive le Diable! French
Constancy, French Integrity’ (date uncertain, but some
time in April 1815) is credited to Rowlandson. A French
soldier, musket in one hand, snuff-box in the other, has
three different knots of ribbon in his hat&mdash;a red one, ‘Vive
le Diable!’ a white one, ‘Vive le Roi!’ and a tricoloured one,
Vive l’Empereur!’ A windmill typifies French stability,
and a monkey and cat, embracing and fondling, show
‘French union between the National Guard and troops of
the Line.’</p>

<p>On April 12, 1815, was published an etching, not signed,
but accredited to Rowlandson, ‘Scene in a New Pantomime
to be performed at the Theatre Royal, Paris. With entire
new Music, Dances, Dresses, Scenery, Machinery, &amp;c.
The principal Characters to be supported by most of the
great Potentates of Europe. Harlequin by M<sup>r</sup> Napoleon.
Clown by King Wirtemberg. Pantaloon, Emperor of
Austria. To conclude with a comic song to be sung by
the Pope, and a Grand Chorus by the crown’d heads.’</p>

<p>In this caricature we see Napoleon, habited as harlequin,
a dagger in each hand, leaping into the unknown,
through a ‘practicable’ portrait of ‘Louis le bien aimé.’
He is pursued by all the European Powers. Clown fires<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
two pistols at him, but overthrows Spain, who has just
drawn his sword. Russia pricks him in the rear with a
lance. Holland and Prussia are firing at him; whilst some
one is taking down from the wall the portrait of the Empress
as Columbine.</p>

<p>In horrible taste is Rowlandson’s picture of ‘The Corsican
and his Bloodhounds at the Window of the Thuilleries,
looking over Paris’ (April 16, 1815). The scene
is a balcony, in which are Napoleon and some of his marshals.
The balcony is inscribed ‘More horrors, Death and
Destruction.’ The Devil is hugging Ney and Napoleon,
and Death is pointing to the streets of Paris, where is a
surging mob, with heads on pikes, &amp;c.</p>

  <img src="images/i_223.jpg" width="600" height="458" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE CORSICAN’S LAST TRIP.</div></div>

<p>‘The Corsican’s last trip under the guidance of his
Good Angel’ (April 16, 1815) has no artist’s name attached.
It represents Bonaparte, and the Devil, taking a prodigious
leap from Elba, to the throne, and sovereign power.</p>

<p>‘The Phenix of Elba resuscitated by Treason’ is by
G. Cruikshank (May 1, 1815), and is a very elaborate plate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
A witch, whose hands drop gore, presides over the resuscitation,
saying, ‘Rise, Spirit, that can never rest, sweet
Bloodthirsty Soul! Offspring of Treason! come forth.’
Obedient to her exorcisms, the Phœnix (Napoleon) rises
from a caldron, exclaiming, ‘Veni, Vidi, Vici!’ Around
the caldron gleefully dance the marshals of the Empire,
singing, ‘Ah! ha! by gar, now we shall begin our Bloody
work again;’ and in the heavens is shown a genius, having
a crown and sceptre in one hand, and a guillotine in the
other, who says, ‘Rise, rise, thou favor’d son of Fate!
Death or a Diadem shall reward thy labours.’</p>

<p>In one part of the picture is shown the Prince Regent
indolently reclining on a divan, a huge decanter by his
side, the prime minister presenting him with the news of
the <i>Return of Boney to Paris</i> and the <i>Decision of Congress</i>:
saying at the same time, ‘May it please my Prince, but
these are events we never calculated upon. I had no
objection to the sacrifice of Saxony to the ambition of
Prussia: I had no objection to the views of Alexander
upon Poland: I had no objection to the transfer of Norway
to Sweden: I had no objection to the union of Belgium
with Holland: I had no objection to all these things; but I
could not foresee that the people would be dissatisfied and
wish for the return of Buonaparte&mdash;to which I have every
objection.’ The Regent, his eyes starting out of his head,
exclaims, ‘How? shall I lose Hanover? shall I lose all
we have been fighting for?’</p>

<p>In another part is Solomon’s Temple, in which sit the
Congress, wrangling over the division of a huge cake. Gouty
Louis the Eighteenth, mounted on a donkey, is off, hard
gallop, to Vienna, calling out, ‘Gee up, Neddy&mdash;adieu to
the Lily in the Violet season! adieu to my good City of
Paris!’ whilst Wellington, on horseback, is going full
speed to Belgium.</p>

May 29, 1815.</p>

<p>S.&nbsp;T. Taw, a new caricaturist, gives us ‘The Crown Candidates,
or a modest request politely refused’ (May 1815).
Louis the Eighteenth, Napoleon, and the young King of
Rome are seated at a table. The former is saying, in the
hopes of an amicable settlement being come to, ‘Sire,
when you have done with the Empire, I will thank you to
let me have it.’ Napoleon replies, ‘I am sorry, Sire, it is
engaged for that young Gentleman.’ The King of Rome
has a torn map, which he is trying to piece, and he says,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>‘I think I shall be able to unite them.’</p>

<p>G. Cruikshank drew (June 1, 1815) ‘Preparing for War,’
which is somewhat elaborate in detail. The centre is occupied
by a funeral pyre, to which fire has already been applied,
‘Sacred to the Bourbon cause, and dedicated to the Downfall
of illegitimate Tyranny.’ Atop of this is chained a bull,
decked with flowers for the sacrifice, and draped with a
cloth, on which is inscribed: ‘Land Tax&mdash;Ditto Personal&mdash;Tax
on Windows, Dogs, Houses, Servants, Clerks, Shopmen,
Carts, Hair powder, Horses, Waiters, Travellers,
Income, Armorial bearings,’ &amp;c. &amp;c. Poor John Bull
bellows, ‘Alas, and must I come to this! have I bled for
so many years in your service, and will you now take my
life?’ A typical representative of the House of Commons
assures him that it is ‘Better to die Johnny, than live,
and see thrive the thing we hate&mdash;Let us arm&mdash;war&mdash;war&mdash;interminable
war I say, down with the Regicide&mdash;no
quarter to the Usurper&mdash;So I said at Congress, so I now
repeat, and if it is your fate to expire at the Altar, Johnny,
all I ask is that I may live to preach your funeral sermon.’
A typical House of Lords is about to give him the <i>coup de
grâce</i> with a pole-axe inscribed ‘New War Taxes,’ comforting
him with ‘No grumbling Johnny, you are a Noble
<i>Sacrifice</i> and worthy of the Cause.’ A number of empty
bags are waiting to be filled&mdash;‘Subsidies,’ ‘The Army,’
‘The Navy,’ ‘Contractors,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>The left-hand portion of the picture shows the Prince
Regent reclining idly on the throne undergoing his toilet.
His idea of the gravity of the situation may be gathered
from his speech: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>‘Why this looks like war! Order me a
brilliant Fête, send me a Myriad of Cooks and Scullions&mdash;say
to me no more of Civil Lists and deserted wives, but
of lascivious Mistresses and Bacchanalian Orgies&mdash;To it,
Pell mell&mdash;my soul is eager for the fierce encounter&mdash;What,
are my Whiskers<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> easier than they were?’ One of his
valets says, ‘Your highness shall in all things be obey’d’;
whilst one, who is measuring him round the waist, tells
him, ‘I think these will be the best stays your highness
has had yet.’</p>

<p>In the background are seen soldiery, and Wellington
and Blücher sharpening their swords. Poor gouty Louis
is clad in armour, and is mounted on Talleyrand as a
charger. He is accompanied by an army of two men,
armed with bottles of <i>Eau Medicinal</i>, and his artillery is
composed of rolls of flannel. He soliloquises: ‘Well&mdash;we’ve
<i>Tally</i> for the Field to-morrow! but don’t forget the <i>Eau
Medicinal</i> and the <i>Fleecy Hosiery</i>; alas! these gouty limbs
are but ill adapted to Jack boots and spurs&mdash;I think I had
better fight my battles over a cool bottle with my friend
George.’</p>

<p>The extreme right of the engraving shews Napoleon
giving orders to ‘Let loose the Dogs of War;’ which is
obeyed by one of his marshals, who delightedly exclaims,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>‘Here is a glorious pack already sniffing human blood, and
fresh for slaughter&mdash;&mdash;On&mdash;comrades&mdash;on! the word is
Bonaparte, Beelzebub and Blood.’</p>

<p>It was time to prepare for war, with a vengeance. On
March 25 a treaty had been concluded at Vienna between
Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, binding themselves
to maintain the Treaty of Paris, to keep each 150,000
men in the field, and not to leave off until Napoleon had
been rendered harmless.</p>

<p>British gold had to be lavishly employed: the King of
Würtemberg receiving from our Government 11<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> for
each man, to the number of 29,000, which he bound himself
to bring into the field.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> But the campaign in Belgium
was to be a short one. We all know it, and its glorious
end, at Waterloo. The news of that victory flew as never
news flew before, for on the 22nd inst. was published the
following official bulletin:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">‘Downing Street, June 22, 1815.</p>

<p>‘The Duke of Wellington’s Dispatch, dated Waterloo,
the 19th of June, states that on the preceding day Buonaparte
attacked, with his whole force, the British line,
supported by a corps of Prussians; which attack, after a
long and sanguinary conflict, terminated in the complete
overthrow of the Enemy’s Army, with the loss of <span class="smcap">One
Hundred</span> and <span class="smcap">Fifty Pieces</span> of <span class="smcap">Cannon</span>, and <span class="smcap">Two
Eagles</span>. During the night, the Prussians under Marshall
Blücher, who joined in the pursuit of the Enemy, captured
<span class="smcap">Sixty Guns</span>, and a large part of Buonaparte’s <span class="smcap">Baggage</span>.
The Allied Armies continued to pursue the enemy. Two
French Generals were taken.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Although jubilant exceedingly, the nation hardly yet
comprehended the value of that victory; in fact, in reading
the immediate contemporary comments thereon, there
seems to be a dread of Napoleon’s powers of resource and
recuperation, and the illuminations which followed were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
not so enthusiastically described as on some other occasions.</p>

<p>One caricaturist seems to have been gifted with prescience,
for before the victory became known he had produced
a caricature which was called ‘A Lecture on Heads,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
as Delivered by Marshalls Wellington and Blucher’ (artist
unknown, June 21, 1815), which shews these heroes dealing
death and destruction on the French all round them,
making the heads fly all over the place. Blücher shouts
out, ‘Blister ’em, Fire ’em, shoot ’em, Kick ’em, Lump ’em,
Thump ’em, whack ’em, smack ’em.’ Wellington <span class="locked">sings&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘R. Ackermann’s Transparency on the Victory of
Waterloo’ is said to be by Rowlandson, and is without
date. It, doubtless, was got up on the news of that great
battle, but it is a very weak production. It simply represents
Napoleon between Wellington and Blücher: the
latter meets him with artillery, the former pursues him on
horseback. Of course his crown has tumbled off. It is
not an artistic picture by any means, but, doubtless, it
evoked the enthusiasm of the masses, who were intoxicated
with joy at the famous victory.</p>

<p>After the battle of Waterloo, Napoleon hastened to
Paris, and, tired and covered with dust as he was, he
immediately met his Ministers, and told them the extent
of his disasters. They laid the intelligence before the
Houses of Legislature, and on the morning of June 22
Napoleon received a deputation from the Chamber, who
submitted to him that ‘the state of war in which France
was involved concerned much less the nation than himself,
and that the Assembly had the means at command, if he
would act so disinterested a part as to restore to it freedom
of action according as circumstances might dictate.’</p>

<p>This was a pretty broad hint to Napoleon to abdicate,
and he took it as such, and sent the following <span class="locked">reply:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘Frenchmen! When I began the war to uphold national independence,
I relied on the union of all efforts, all wills, and on
the co-operation of all national authorities. I was justified in
anticipating success, and I braved all the declarations of the
Powers against my person. Circumstances seem to be changed.
I offer myself as a sacrifice to the hatred against France. May
your enemies prove sincere, and may it appear that they wage war
against me alone! My political life is terminated. I proclaim
my son, under the title of Napoleon II., Emperor of the French.
The present Ministers will form the Council of the Provisional
Government. The interest which I take in my son induces me
to invite the Chambers to organize a Regency without delay, by a
special law. Unite for the general safety, and to secure national
independence.</p>

<p>The ‘Times,’<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> as usual, must speak bitter things of the
fallen foe, and, anent his abdication, says, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>‘The wretch,
with the blood of so many thousands on his head, seemed
to carry about him all the coolness of that apathy which is
part of his physical constitution; and so degraded and
demoralised are the Parisian populace, that they could see
the butcher of their race without the least emotion. He
is, however, spoken of in the journals, and in the debates,
without any share of that respect which but lately was
attached to his name. After his former abdication, he was
invariably termed the “Emperor”; but now he is called
nothing but plain Napoleon.’</p>

<span class="subhead">NAPOLEON A PRISONER&mdash;SENT TO THE ISLE OF AIX&mdash;NEGOTIATIONS FOR
SURRENDER&mdash;GOES ON BOARD THE ‘BELLEROPHON.’</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Napoleon retired to Malmaison, but was not long there
before General Becker came to him and informed him that
he was appointed by the Provisional Government to command
the troops detailed for his protection. Napoleon
knew the meaning of this message, but even being made a
prisoner by his own soldiery did not quell his spirit.</p>

<p>But the presence of Napoleon at Malmaison embarrassed
the Government, and Becker had orders to convey Napoleon
with all speed to the Isle of Aix. Accordingly they
set out, and reached Rochefort on July 3, where he
remained until the 8th, when he embarked on board the
‘Saale’ frigate, but without any hope of getting to sea,
because of the blockade of the port by the ‘Bellerophon’
and other English men-of-war. He occasionally landed
on the Isle of Aix; but all hopes of reaching America
seem to have been abandoned, as Las Cases and Savary
were sent on board the ‘Bellerophon’ to inquire of Captain
Maitland whether he knew anything of the passports
Napoleon expected from the British Government, and
whether any opposition would be offered to his sailing to
the United States. Captain Maitland replied that he
knew nothing of the intentions of his Government, but
he certainly could not allow any ship-of-war to leave the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
port, and in the course of conversation asked, ‘Why not
seek an asylum in England?’</p>

<p>The hint thus dropped fructified; for, after another
visit of Las Cases and General Lallemand on board the
‘Bellerophon’ on July 14, avowedly to repeat their previous
questions, the matter was openly discussed, and on
mentioning the result of their interview to the Emperor he
agreed to this course, and desired Las Cases to tell Captain
Maitland to prepare and receive him and his suite the next
day. At the same time he entrusted General Gourgaud
with an autograph letter to the Prince Regent, directing
him to take it to England and deliver it into the Prince’s
own hands.</p>

<p>From the date of this letter, which was the 13th, it
would seem that Napoleon had, on the previous day, made
up his mind what course to pursue. The following is the
text of the <span class="locked">letter:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your Royal Highness,</p>

<p class="in0" style="text-indent: 4em;">Exposed to the factions which divide my Country, and
to the enmity of the greatest Powers of Europe, I have terminated
my political career; and I come, like Themistocles, to throw
myself upon the hospitality of the British People. I place myself
under the protection of their laws, which I claim from your Royal
Highness, as the most powerful, the most constant, and the most
generous, of my enemies.</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="smcap">Napoleon.</span><br /></p>

<p class="in0 in1 smaller">Rochefort, 13th July, 1815.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the 15th, then, Napoleon and suite went on board
the ‘Bellerophon,’ where they were received by Captain
Maitland and his officers; the Emperor saying, ‘I am
come to throw myself on the Protection of your Prince and
Laws.’</p>

<p>Caricature of such a scene seems to be in very bad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
taste, but as it was done, and is so truly comic, I cannot
refrain from reproducing it.</p>

  <div class="caption">COMPLIMENTS AND CONGÉES.</div></div>

<p>‘Compliments and Congées, or Little Boney’s surrender
to the Tars of Old England!!!’ is a highly humorous
picture by G. Cruikshank (July 24, 1815). Napoleon surrenders
himself, cringing and weeping, together with his
suite, whom he describes, on board the ‘Bellerophon,’ and
is received with due respect by Captain Maitland. The
ex-Emperor says, ‘O, Mr. Bull, I am so happy to see you,
I always had a great regard for the British Sailors, they
are such noble fellows, so brave, so generous!! You see I
am in a great deal of trouble, but I hope you will take pity
on me and my suite, namely my barber, my cook, and my
washerwoman, together with a few of my <i>brave</i> generals who
ran away with me from the Battle of Waterloo, and I do
assure you we will have great <i>pleasure</i> in surrendering to the
good English&mdash;I should feel extremely obliged if you would
take us to America, but if you will not, I beg you will take
us to England, for I hate those Bears, and cursed Cossacks,
and as for the French Nation now&mdash;why they may be
d&mdash;d. Old England for ever I say.’ And his suite
servilely follow their fallen master’s lead with cries of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>‘Vivent les Anglais!’</p>

<p>Captain Maitland receives him with doffed hat and his
hand on his heart, saying, ‘Indeed Mr. Boney I am greatly
obliged to you for your compliments, and I assure you we
are as happy to receive you, as you are to surrender. I’m
afraid they would not take that care of you in America,
that they will in England. Therefore I shall conduct you
to the latter place, as quick as possible.’ The opinions of
the sailors are more graphic than polite: ‘My eyes, what
a sneaking hound he is!!’ ‘I say Jack, do you think
they’ll clap him in Exeter Change amongst the wild beasts?’
‘No, I suppose as how he’ll be put in the Monkey’s den
in the Tower, or else they’ll send him about with the
dancing bear!’</p>

<p>Charles etched (July 15, 1815) ‘The Bone-a-part in a
fresh place.’ This represents Bonaparte caught in a spring
man-trap, which has broken his leg. He surrenders his
sword to John Bull, who is dressed as a gardener: ‘Here
take this Mr. Bull, you have me in your power&mdash;I must
trust to your usual generosity, and most humbly acknowledge
that I am truly sorry I ever came here.’ John Bull
makes no answer, but soliloquises thus instead: ‘He has
plundered most of his neighbours’ Gardens, but I thought
he would be sorry if ever he set his foot in mine. I suppose
this big sword is what he intended to cut my cabbages
with, and perhaps my head too! but I’ll have it for a
pruning knife, ’twill serve me to lop his Branches with, if
any should spring up after I have taken care of him.’</p>

<p>G. Cruikshank, in August 1815, published a contrast&mdash;‘Buonaparte
on the 17th of June&mdash;Buonaparte on the 17th
of July, 1815.’ On the former date he is seen vapouring
on the French coast, flourishing his sword, and calling out,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>‘Ha, ha, you Bull beast, you Blackguard Islander, you see
I am come back again, and now you shall see what I shall
do with you, you wretch! you thought I was done over,
did you? you thought I was going to stay at Elba? D&mdash;n
all Elbas, abdications, Englishmen and their Allies. I’ll
play Hell with them all.’ John Bull, seated securely on
his own shore, calmly enjoying his tankard of ale and his
long clay pipe, puffs out a huge mouthful of smoke at his
adversary, with a contemptuous ‘You may be d&mdash;d. I’ll
make a Tobacco stopper of you.’</p>

<p>But within one short month what a change had come
over the scene! Napoleon, a weeping, kneeling suppliant,
on board the ‘Bellerophon,’ moans <span class="locked">out:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O good Mr. Bull! I wish you to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Although you are my greatest foe,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That my career is at an end:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I wish you now to stand my friend.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I was by you beat black &amp; blue,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And now if in England you’ll let me remain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ne’er will be guilty of bad Tricks again.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>John Bull, however, knowing the slippery customer he has
to deal with, reflects: ‘Let me see;&mdash;first of all you sprung
from the <i>Island</i> of <i>Corsica</i>, and when you was kick’d out of
France, and went to the <i>Island</i> of <i>Elba</i>, you made another
spring into France again.&mdash;And now when you are kick’d
out of France a second time, you want to come and live on
my <i>Island</i>&mdash;But it won’t do, Master Boney;&mdash;you’ll be
making another spring into France again, I suppose&mdash;so I
tell you what&mdash;I’ll send you to the <i>Island</i> of <i>St. Helena</i>,
and we’ll see what sort of a spring you’ll make then.’</p>

<p>George Cruikshank contributes a very badly drawn
etching (September 1, 1815) of ‘Boney’s threatened Invasion
brought to bear,&mdash;or, taking a View of the English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
coast from y<sup>e</sup> Poop of the Bellerophon.’ The English
coast is represented by a ‘Citadel,’ in front of which is a
gallows prepared. One of his suite points it out to him:
‘By gar! mon Emperor, dey have erect von prospect for
you.’ Napoleon, who is mounted on a breech of the gun,
looks through his telescope and says, ‘Me no like the d&mdash;n
prospect.’ A Jack Tar sitting on another gun gives as his
opinion, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>‘I thinks as how, Master Boney, that instead of
sending you to <i>Hell bay</i>, they should have sent you to Hell
at once.’</p>

<p>NAPOLEON ON BOARD THE ‘BELLEROPHON’&mdash;ARRIVAL AT TORBAY&mdash;CURIOSITY
OF THE PEOPLE&mdash;THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT DETERMINE
TO SEND HIM TO ST. HELENA.</p></blockquote>

<p>On board the ‘Bellerophon’ he was treated with every consideration
by Captain Maitland. He was still looked upon
as Emperor, and dined off his own gold plate, the dinner
being ordered by his own <i>maître d’hôtel</i>; and when he visited
the ‘Superb’ he was received with all the honours accorded
to royalty, with the exception of a salute being fired. On
the 16th July they set sail for England, and at daybreak on
the 24th they were close to Dartmouth. Napoleon rose at
six and went on the poop, surveying the coast, which he
much admired: ‘What a beautiful country! it very much
resembles Porto Ferrajo at Elba.’</p>

<p>About eight <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> they anchored at Torbay, and no
sooner was it known that Napoleon was on board the
‘Bellerophon’ than the bay was covered with vessels and
boats full of people. A neighbouring gentleman sent the
Emperor a present of fruit. What a different reception
from the language of the ‘Times’<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Our paper of this day will satisfy the sceptics, for such
there were beginning to be, as to the capture of that bloody
miscreant, who has so long tortured Europe, <span class="smcap">Napoleon
Buonaparte</span>. Savages are always found to unite the
greatest degree of cunning to the ferocious part of their
nature. The cruelty of this person is written in characters
of blood in almost every country in Europe, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
contiguous angles of Africa and Asia which he visited
and nothing can more strongly evince the universal conviction
of his low, perfidious craft, than the opinion which
was beginning to get abroad, that even after his capture
had been officially announced, in both France, and England,
he might yet have found means to escape. However,
all doubts upon this point are at an end, by his
arrival off the British coast; and, if he be not now placed
beyond the possibility of again outraging the peace of
Europe, England will certainly never again deserve to
have heroes such as those who have fought, and bled, at
Waterloo, for this, his present overthrow. The lives of
the brave men who fell on that memorable day will have
been absolutely thrown away by a thoughtless country;
the grand object attained by their valour will have been
frustrated, and we shall do little less than insult over their
remains, almost before they have ceased to bleed. But
Fortune, seconding their undaunted efforts, has put it in
our power to do far otherwise.</p>

<p>‘Captain Sartorius of the <i>Slaney</i> frigate, arrived yesterday
with dispatches from Captain Maitland of the <i>Bellerophon</i>,
confirming all the antecedent accounts of Buonaparte’s
surrender, with various other details, and closing them
by their natural catastrophe&mdash;his safe conveyance to England.
He is, therefore, what we may call, here. Captain
Sartorius delivered his dispatches to Lord Melville, at
Wimbledon, by whom their contents were communicated
to Lord Liverpool, at his seat at Combe Wood; summonses
were immediately issued for a Cabinet Council to
meet at 12 o’clock; what passed there was, of course, not
suffered to transpire; our narrative must therefore revert
to the <i>Slaney</i> frigate, and the accounts brought by her.
She had been sent forward by Captain Maitland to Plymouth,
with the dispatches announcing that Buonaparte<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
was on board the <i>Bellerophon</i>, with a numerous suite. But
it was the intention of Captain Maitland himself, to proceed
to Torbay, and not to land his prisoners until he had
received orders from Government.</p>

<p>‘Buonaparte’s suite, as it is called, consists of upwards
of 40 persons, among whom was Bertrand, Savary, Lallemand!
Grogan,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> and several women. He has been allowed
to take on board carriages and horses, but admission was
denied to about 50 cavalry, for whom he had the impudence
to require accommodation. This wretch has really lived
in the commission of every crime, so long, that he has lost
all sight and knowledge of the difference that exists
between good and evil, and hardly knows when he is
doing wrong, except he be taught by proper chastisement.
A creature&mdash;who ought to be greeted with a gallows as
soon as he lands&mdash;to think of an attendance of fifty horsemen!
He had at first wanted to make conditions with
Captain Maitland as to his treatment, but the British
officer very properly declared that he must refer him
upon this subject to his Government.</p>

<p>‘When he had been some time on board, he asked the
Captain what chance two large frigates, well manned, would
have with a seventy-four. The answer, we understand,
which he received to this enquiry, did not give him any
cause to regret that he had not tried his fortune in a naval
combat with the relative forces in question. By the way,
we should not have been surprised if he had come into an
action with the two frigates, and then endeavoured to
escape in his own, and leave the other to her fate. It has
been the constant trick of this villain, whenever he has got
his companions into a scrape, to leave them in it, and seek
his own safety by flight. In Egypt, in the Moscow expedition,
and at Waterloo, such was his conduct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
‘He likewise had the assurance to address a letter to the
Prince Regent, and M. Grogan, one of his party, was put
on board the <i>Slaney</i> as the bearer of it; but when this
vessel reached Plymouth, the officer on duty there, with a
decision that does him credit, refused Grogan permission
to land: the letter is said to have been conveyed by Captain
Sartorius, and its purport was understood, on board, to
be a request for passports for America. We should have
supposed that he had received too many checks before, for
his presumption in addressing letters to the British Government,
ever to have hazarded that experiment again; but
all reproofs are thrown away upon his callous heart;&mdash;not
that we should object to his humbly addressing the British
throne for mercy, if he has anything to urge in extenuation
of his crimes; but the time has not yet come; a momentary
gleam of resolution on the part of his own Government,
indicated by the imprisonment of Labédoyère, and others,
led us to hope that his trial might have been safely entrusted
to those to whom it primarily, and of natural right,
belongs; but, though this hope may have proved transitory,
he is not, therefore, above the criminal justice of other
countries, where established law, and a regular execution
of it, prevails.</p>

<p>‘The first procedure, we trust, will be a special commission,
or the appointment of a court martial, to try him
for the murder of Captain Wright. It is nonsense to say,
as some have, that courts martial are instituted only to try
offences committed by soldiers of the country to which
they belong: it was an American court martial that tried
and shot Major André as a spy; and Buonaparte himself
appointed commissions of all kinds, and in all countries, to
try offences committed against himself.’</p>

<p>The same paper says: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>‘As soon as an august personage
was informed of the capture of Buonaparte, he communicated
this important intelligence to a prince of his family&mdash;“The
ancient fable is at length realised: the <i>Chimera</i> is in the
power of <i>Bellerophon</i>, and will not this time escape again.”</p>

<p>‘[Every reader knows that the Chimera was a terrible
monster that vomited fire.]’</p>

<p>Rowlandson gives us (July 28, 1815) ‘Boney’s Trial,
Sentence and Dying Speech, or Europe’s injuries revenged.’
Boney is in the felon’s dock, backed up by his old friend
the Devil. His indictment sets forth thus: ‘Napolean
Boneparte, The first and last, by the wrath of Heaven,
Ex Emperor of Jacobins and Head Runner of Runaways,
stands indicted 1st for the murder of Captain Wright, in
the Temple at Paris. 2nd for the murder of the Duke
d’Enghien, Pichegru and Georges. 3rd for the murder of
Palm, Hofer, &amp;c. &amp;c. 4th for the murder of the 12 inhabitants
of Moscow. 5th for innumerable Robberies committed
on all Nations in Christendom, and elsewhere. 6th
for bigamy, and lastly for returning from Transportation,
and setting the World in an uproar.’ Blücher presides,
assisted by all the European sovereigns, and gives sentence
thus: ‘You, Nap Boneparte, being found guilty of all these
crimes, it is fell to my lot to pronounce sentence of Death
upon you. You are to be hung by the neck for one hour,
till you are <i>Dead, dead, dead</i>, and your body to be chained
to a mill stone, and sunk in the sea at Torbay.’</p>

<p>Napoleon, terrified at this sentence, weepingly implores,
‘Oh Cruel Blucher! Oh Cruel Wellington! it is you that
have brought me to this end. Oh, magnanimous Emperors,
Kings and Princes! intercede for me, and spare my life,
and give me time to atone for all my sins. My Son,
Napoleon the Second, will reward you for mercy shewn
me.’</p>

<p>On July 26 orders came for the ‘Bellerophon’ to go to
Plymouth; which being reached, two frigates, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>‘Liffey’
and ‘Eurotas,’ were anchored, one on either side of her,
and kept strict guard over her. No boat from the shore
was allowed to come within a cable’s length of her, and
ships’ boats continually rowing around kept that space
clear.</p>

<span class="i0">And Impatience, that vixen, begins interference;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To beguile her, through portholes we eagerly stare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the nobles on deck are all taking the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Hey dey what a bustle!’ then ‘All safe, all safe.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowd is return’d to its chatter and laugh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Pray what was the matter?’ ‘From that boat, near the ship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman fell over, and so got a dip.’<br /></span>

<p>This doggerel helps us to realise the intense desire of
the British public to get at least a glimpse at Boney, that
great bugbear who for so many years had been so great a
terror to them, and whose existence everyone, from the
highest to the lowest, had acutely felt in that tenderest
place of our social economy&mdash;the breeches pocket. They
all but carried out the threat, made twelve years previously,
of putting him in Pidcock’s Menagerie, <i>vide</i> the following
extracts from a contemporary pamphlet<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘The desire of all ranks to see him was excessive; the
guardboats were unable to prevent them from closing the
ship, and it was amusement on board to look at the boats
contending for places. Napoleon generally walked the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
quarterdeck about eleven in the forenoon, and half past
six in the afternoon. He ate but two meals in the day,
both alike, meat of every description, different wines, coffee,
fruit, &amp;c. Immediately after each meal he rose first, and
the others followed; he then either went on the quarterdeck
or in the after-cabin to study. The comedy of <i>The
Poor Gentleman</i><a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> was performed before him; he was much
pleased at it; it went off very well; the scenery was good,
but somewhat better dresses were wanted for the <i>female
midshipmen</i>.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>‘The immense number of persons who daily flock from
all parts of the country to take a view of the person of
Napoleon is incalculable. He generally gratified the
public curiosity by making his appearance every afternoon
for two hours.</p>

<p>‘Upwards of one thousand boats were from morning to
night round the <i>Bellerophon</i>. The seamen of the <i>Bellerophon</i>
adopted a curious mode to give an account to the
curious spectators in the boats of the movements of Napoleon.
They wrote in chalk, on a board, which they exhibited,
a short account of his different occupations&mdash;“At
breakfast”&mdash;“In the cabin with Captain Maitland”&mdash;“Writing
with his officers”&mdash;“Going to dinner”&mdash;“Coming
upon deck,” &amp;c.’</p>

<p>Las Cases says: ‘It was known that he always appeared
on deck towards five o’clock. A short time before
this hour, all the boats collected alongside of each other;
there were thousands; and so closely were they connected,
that the water could no longer be seen between them.
They looked more like a multitude assembled in a public
square than anything else. When the Emperor came out,
the noise and gestures of so many people presented a most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
striking spectacle; it was, at the same time, very easy to
perceive that nothing hostile was meant, and that, if
curiosity had brought them, they felt interested on going
away. We could even see that the latter sentiment continued
to increase; at first, people merely looked toward
the ship, they ended by saluting; some remained uncovered,
and, occasionally, went so far as to cheer. Even
our symbols began to appear amongst them. Several
individuals of both sexes came decorated with red carnations.’</p>

<p>Napoleon knew that St. Helena had been fixed upon
as the place of his future residence, and did not at all relish
the idea; but it was not officially announced to him until
July 30 or 31, when Lord Keith went on board the
‘Bellerophon’ and presented him with the following <span class="locked">despatch:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p class="p2 center larger">‘<i>Communication made by Lord Keith, in the name of the
English Ministers.</i></p>

<p>‘As it may, perhaps, be convenient for General Buonaparte
to learn, without further delay, the intentions of the
British Government with regard to him, your Lordship
will communicate the following information.</p>

<p>‘It would be inconsistent with our duty towards our
country and the Allies of his Majesty, if General Buonaparte
possessed the means of again disturbing the repose
of Europe. It is on this account, that it becomes absolutely
necessary he should be restrained in his personal
liberty, so far as this is required by the foregoing important
object.</p>

<p>‘The island of St. Helena has been chosen as his future
residence; its climate is healthy, and its local position will
allow of his being treated with more indulgence than could
be admitted in any other spot, owing to the indispensable
precautions which it would be necessary to employ for the
security of his person.</p>

<p>‘General Buonaparte is allowed to select amongst those
persons who accompanied him to England (with the exception
of Generals Savary and Lallemand) three officers,
who, together with his surgeon, will have permission to
accompany him to St. Helena; these individuals will not
be allowed to quit the island without the sanction of the
British Government.</p>

<p>‘Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn, who is named
Commander in Chief at the Cape of Good Hope, and seas
adjacent, will convey General Buonaparte and his suite to
St. Helena; and he will receive detailed instructions relative
to the execution of this service.</p>

<p>‘Sir G. Cockburn will, most probably, be ready to sail
in a few days; for which reason, it is desirable that General
Buonaparte should make choice of the persons who are to
accompany him, without delay.’</p>

<p>Of this interview Las Cases says: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>‘I was not called
before the Emperor. The bearers of his sentence spoke
and understood French; they were admitted alone. I
have since heard that he objected, and protested, with no
less energy than logic, against the violence exercised on
his person. “He was the guest of England,” said Napoleon,
“and not its prisoner; he came of his own accord to
place himself under the protection of its laws; the most
sacred rights of hospitality were violated in his person; he
would never submit voluntarily to the outrage they were
preparing for him: violence alone should oblige him to do
so,” &amp;c.’</p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">NAPOLEON IS SENT ON BOARD THE ‘NORTHUMBERLAND’&mdash;HE PROTESTS
AGAINST HIS EXILE&mdash;PUBLIC OPINION AS TO HIS TREATMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>That the Government was in earnest, as to his departure,
was soon shown, for orders came on August 4 for the
‘Bellerophon’ to weigh, and join the ‘Northumberland,’
which was the ship in which Napoleon was to take his
passage to St. Helena. He issued a formal <span class="locked">protest:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I hereby solemnly protest in the face of heaven and mankind
against the violence that is done me; and the violation of my
most sacred rights, in forcibly disposing of my person and liberty.
I voluntarily came on board the <i>Bellerophon</i>&mdash;I am not the
prisoner, I am the guest of England. I came at the instigation of
the Captain himself, who said he had orders from the Government
to receive and convey me to England, together with my suite, if
agreeable to me. I came forward with confidence to place myself
under the protection of the laws of England. When once on
board the <i>Bellerophon</i>, I was entitled to the hospitality of the
British people. If the Government, in giving the Captain of the
<i>Bellerophon</i> orders to receive me and my followers, only wished to
lay a snare, it has forfeited its honour, and disgraced its flag.</p>

<p>If this act be consummated, it will be in vain for the English,
henceforth, to talk of their sincerity, their laws, and liberties.
British faith will have been lost in the hospitality of the <i>Bellerophon</i>.</p>

<p>I appeal to History; it will say, that an enemy, who made war
for twenty years against the English people, came spontaneously,
in the hour of misfortune, to seek an asylum under their laws.
What more striking proof could he give of his esteem and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span> confidence?
But how did England reply to such an act of magnanimity?
It pretended to hold out a hospitable hand to this
enemy: and on giving himself up with confidence, he was
immolated!</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="smcap">Napoleon.</span><br /></p>

<p class="in1 smaller"><i>Bellerophon</i>, at Sea. Friday, Aug. 4th, 1815.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the 6th they anchored off Start Point, and were
soon joined by the ‘Northumberland’ and two frigates, full
of soldiers, who were to form the garrison of St. Helena.
By order, their arms were taken from them, with the exception
of Napoleon, who was allowed to keep his sword;
all their money, diamonds, and saleable effects were put
under seal; but Napoleon might keep his plate, baggage,
wines, and provisions. The search of his personal effects
greatly exasperated him.</p>

<p>Between one and two o’clock <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> of the 7th, the transfer
from the ‘Bellerophon’ to the ‘Northumberland’ was
made, and then, as there was nothing else to wait for,
‘Cæsar and his fortunes’ sailed for St. Helena.</p>

<p>The ‘Times’ (August 11, 1815) has the following short
leader: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>‘We trust that we now, at last, take a long leave
of <span class="smcap">Napoleon Buonaparte</span>, except that we may, occasionally,
have to instance him as an example of every
crime, for the benefit of others: and, if the hand of man
has dealt too leniently by his offences, it must not, on that
occasion, be conceived that he is exempt from every other
punishment. To what profession of faith he may now
belong, we know not, as we believe he has been Atheist,
Mahometan, and Roman Catholic, in succession, as best
suited the particular purpose of the moment: indeed, such
was the inherent baseness of the man, notwithstanding his
eminent talents, and incessant activity, that he was in the
habitual practice of the meanest arts of deception for the
promotion of his interest, never blushing at the subsequent
exposure of his falsehoods, or the discovery of his expedients,
provided they had first promoted the object he had
in view.</p>

<p>‘Yet if he is still a man, he must, now that he is reduced
to solitude and leisure, have some religion or other
engraven in his soul, that will make him feel compunction
for the many horrible atrocities of which he has been
guilty. It is said that he needs incessant exercise for the
relief of his bilious complaint; perhaps, also, he may now
first discover that he has need of incessant bustle also, in
order to abstract his attention from a certain mental
malady, called an evil conscience. In the midst of the
horror which his crimes always excited in well-constituted
minds, throughout Europe, there was a certain mixture of
contempt, or derision, excited by the little knaveries which
he practised, and the same feeling will not fail to mingle
itself in this the closing scene of his drama, on observing
the attendants of such a man, who had been used to sport
with oaths, to laugh at engagements, to make a mockery
of religion, to commit or direct murder in all its forms,
from the midnight assassination, up to the boundless
slaughter of the tented field, anxious to provide for the
amusement of his, and their, declining years, by a stock of
cards, domino and backgammon tables.’</p>

<p>Whilst they are on their journey, we will just glance at
the few remaining caricatures.</p>

<p>‘The Ex-Emperor in a bottle’ is a somewhat serious,
and well-executed, engraving (August 25, 1815). Napoleon
is enclosed in a glass bottle, which the Prince Regent, who
wears a superb hussar uniform, has just sealed with a seal
bearing the imprint of a cannon and the legend <i>Martial
Achievements</i>; around are grouped the figures named in the
following verses&mdash;Louis the Eighteenth being on his knees,
his eyes being raised in pious thankfulness to Heaven.</p>

<p>‘The downfall of Tyranny and return of Peace’ is
by George Cruikshank, and, although not dated, is undoubtedly
of the autumn of 1815. Justice, with a flaming
sword, has banished Napoleon to his rock of St. Helena,
where, chained, he is seized upon by the fiend as his own.
Peace with her olive branch, Plenty with her cornucopia,
Agriculture and Commerce, are welcomed by Britannia
with open arms.</p>

<p>Marks (August 1815) drew <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>‘The Exile of St. Helena,
or Boney’s Meditation,’ in which there is a fairly accurate
delineation of the Rocky Island and its little town. Napoleon
is standing with his feet astride, each planted on a
rock on either side the bay; he weeps copiously, and the
expression of his countenance is very rueful.</p>

<p>The Devil addressing the Sun.&mdash;<i>Paradise Lost</i>, Book IV.</p></div></div>

<p>‘Napoleon’s trip from Elba to Paris, and from Paris to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
St. Helena’ is the title of three engravings on one sheet,
by G. Cruikshank (September 1, 1815). In the first compartment
is shown the battle of Waterloo, with the French
army in full flight. Napoleon is seated on the French
Eagle, which, however, has but one wing, for, as it mournfully
observes, ‘My <i>left</i> wing has entirely disappeared.’
The Emperor, whose crown and sceptre have fallen from
him, clutches the bird round the neck, exclaiming: ‘Sauve
qui peut&mdash;the Devil take the hindmost&mdash;Run, my boys,
your Emperor leads the way&mdash;My dear eagle, only conduct
me safe to Paris this time, as you did from Moscow
and Leipsig, and I’ll never trouble you again&mdash;Oh! d&mdash;n
that Wellington!’</p>

<p>The middle picture shows Napoleon in the stern gallery
of the ‘Bellerophon,’ talking to John Bull, who sits by his
fireside placidly smoking his pipe as usual. Says the ex-Emperor:
‘My most powerful and generous enemy, how
do you do? I come, like Themistocles, to seat myself
upon your hearth&mdash;I am very glad to see you.’ John Bull
replies: ‘So am I glad to see you Mr. Boney, but I’ll be
d&mdash;d if you sit upon my hearth, or any part of my house&mdash;it
has cost me a pretty round sum to catch you, Mr.
Themistocles, as you call yourself, but now I have got you,
I’ll take care of you.’</p>

<p>The third is a sad one. Napoleon is at St. Helena,
reduced to the sport of catching rats. Across his breast he
wears a broad leather scarf, covered with brass rats, and sits
moodily before a baited trap, into which the rats decline
to enter. He thus <span class="locked">soliloquises:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span></p><div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">And to this moment might have kept them there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had I not gone to hunt the Russian bear.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>One of his suite sees a rat coming: ‘Ah! mon Dieu!
Dere, your Majesty, dere be de vilain rogues&mdash;Ah, monsieur
rat, why you not pop your nose into de trap, and let
de august Emperor catch you?’ A female attendant, with
a slice of bacon on a fork, says, ‘Will your Majesty be
please to try dis bit of bacon? Ah! de cunning rascal!
Dere! ma foi! he sniff at de bacon.’</p>

<p>‘General Sans Pareil’ (September 1, 1815) is an extremely
elaborate picture, far too much so for reproduction;
therefore it will be better to give the description at the
foot of the figure: ‘The above Portrait of Buonaparte,
may be considered as an emblematical Index of his extraordinary
Life. The Design reflects the highest credit on
the Artist, who is a Frenchman: he has judiciously formed
the Hat of the different <i>Crowns</i> which Buonaparte placed
on other Men’s <i>Heads</i>. The position of the forefinger and
thumb are particularly deserving of notice, with the words
<i>Moreau</i> and <i>Pichegru</i> on them, indicating that <i>Moreau</i> was
his guide or <i>finger-post</i> to all his victories; and the word
<i>Pichegru</i> being on his thumb, is meant to imply that he
always had him in view as being one great obstacle to his
rising greatness; while in the other hand he holds a nooze,
or rope, as the means of ridding himself of so formidable
an enemy. The words on his Breast are the names of the
different kingdoms he has overrun or conquered. His
Waistcoat is ornamented with the figures of the different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Kings he had made; the French call them “<i>La folie
fabrique de sire</i>”: indicative, that while the dark clouds of
despotism hung over Buonaparte’s empire, his Kings reflected
their borrowed lustre; but when once the Sun of
universal restitution darted forth its rays, they melted “like
wax before the sun.” The artist has well contrived to put
the little King of Rome, as a monkey, above the heads of
the other Kings. The Bales and Casks of Goods, on his
left thigh, denote the stoppage of Trade which his system
of warfare had brought on the French People. The Beet
root refers to the Decree issued for making Sugar of that
plant, when he had lost all his West India Possessions.
On his legs are represented Skulls, symbolic of Death, who
accompanied him wherever he trod&mdash;His sword, which so
often paralyzed the world, and conquered with a rapidity
hitherto unknown, is placed in the form of a Comet or
Meteor. Such is this brief and imperfect delineation of
the above extremely curious and interesting Portrait.’</p>

<p>‘Boxiana&mdash;or the Fancy’ (artist unknown), October 1,
1815, shows the popular idea of the treatment Napoleon
received. The gross, corpulent Prince Regent has thrown
down his traditional three feathers, and is, like the ex-Emperor,
stripped for the fight. Napoleon is on the
ground, and the Regent is kicking him. A sweep has
picked up one of the Prince’s feathers, and shows it to
Napoleon’s backer, saying, ‘Master, I found a white
feather.’ The backer calls out, ‘Foul! foul! by all the
rules of honor! why even blackey cries shame.’ A negro,
who is acting as bottle-holder, cries <span class="locked">out:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">By the fist of my father, I blush for thee, Ben!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Regent’s backer explains, ‘He’s only kicking, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
try if there’s any honor there, Blackey.’ One of the spectators
imagines that ‘Themistocles will be well treated if
we can find any honor in him!’ Another says, ‘Or we
must send Themistocles to acquire honor at Botany.’</p>

<p>A French spectator turns to an Englishman, saying,
‘Ah, je vois, you be de Jentelman! n’est ce pas bien
Sauvage, Sare?’ The reply is, ‘Bien shove a&mdash;&mdash;e No,
d&mdash;&mdash;e! mounseer, I think it more like kicking than

</div>

<p>The ‘Northumberland’ crossed the Line on September 23,
and the sailors had their then usual bit of fun. Neptune
and Amphitrite came on board, and Napoleon’s suite were
introduced to them in a ceremonious and courtly manner,
escaping the usual ordeal by some small presents to their
Majesties. Napoleon, of course, was sacred, and, when
he was told of the extreme, and unusual, tenderness with
which his followers had been treated, he wanted to give the
crew a hundred napoleons; but the admiral would not allow
it. The caricaturist, however, gives a different version of
the affair.</p>

<p>‘Boney crossing the Line’ is by Marks (September
1815), and illustrates the rough sports which then obtained
on board ship. Napoleon, blindfolded, is thrown into a
tub, where he is being subjected to the usual rough usage,
at the command of Neptune, who, with his spouse, are
drawn on a gun-carriage by sailors. Neptune says, ‘I
command you’l cleanse him from his iniquities.’ Poor
Boney little likes his treatment, ‘I no like de English valet
de Chambre, Have mercy.’ Two French generals stand
by, blindfolded, ready to undergo the same treatment.
One says, ‘I wish de Dirty Job was over;’ the other, ‘Be
gar, me no like de shaving shop.’ But a sailor remarks to
them, ‘Have Patience Gentlemen, and we’ll shave you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
directly, and give you a good <i>lathering</i> as Old Blucher
did!!!’</p>

  <div class="caption">FAST COLOURS.</div></div>

<p>The last caricature I shall reproduce is called ‘Fast
Colours, Patience on a monument smiling at grief, or the
Royal Laundress washing Boney’s Court dresses (G.&nbsp;H.
inv<sup>t</sup>, G. Cruikshank fec<sup>t</sup> October 26, 1815).’ It shows the
poor fatuous Bourbon trying to wash out the tricolour, thus
bemoaning the task: ‘Bless me, how <i>fast</i> these <i>colours</i> are,
I’m afraid I shall not get them <i>white</i>,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> altho’ I have got
such a strong lather.’ Napoleon, seated on his rocky
home, says, ‘Ha, ha! such an old woman as you, may rub a
long while before they’ll be all <i>white</i>, for they are <i>tricoloured
in grain</i>.’ There is another print of the same date and
subject, uncoloured, which has the addition of Wellington,
Russia, Prussia, and Austria stirring linen in a copper of
<i>Holy Water</i>.</p>

<p>From this time the caricatures of Napoleon practically
ceased; and, in the collection of prints in the British
Museum, I can find but two more, published in 1816&mdash;the
‘Mat de Cocagne’ and ‘Royal Christmas boxes’&mdash;both
of which are too silly to reproduce or describe. It is to
the credit of the English, that, in this instance, they respected
the fallen. Napoleon had been captured, disarmed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
and held in safe durance, and from that time, until his
death, we hear but very little of him, and none of that news
is either satirical or spiteful. Clearly, therefore, this book
ends here. It has nothing to do with the voyage to St.
Helena, or with the perpetual squabbles of Napoleon and
his suite with Sir Hudson Lowe, which are fully recorded
by O’Meara and Las Cases. To all intents and purposes,
Napoleon was dead to the English when he left our shores;
and when he passed to his rest on May 5, 1821, all
animosity died with him. Years had even tamed the bitter
scribes of the ‘Times,’ as is evidenced by the leader in that
paper (July 5, 1821) announcing and commenting on his
<span class="locked">decease:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘Thus terminates in exile, and in prison, the most extraordinary
life yet known to political history. The vicissitudes
of such a life, indeed, are the most valuable lessons
which history can furnish. Connected with, and founded
on, the principles of his character, the varieties of fortune
which Buonaparte experienced are of a nature to illustrate
the most useful maxims of benevolence, patriotism, or discretion.
They embrace both extremes of the condition
of man in society, and therefore address themselves to all
ranks of human beings. But Buonaparte was our enemy&mdash;our
defeated enemy&mdash;and, as Englishmen, we must not
tarnish our triumphs over the living warrior by unmanly
injustice towards the dead.</p>

<p>‘The details of his life are notorious, and we omit them.
The community of which Buonaparte was in his early days
a member, and the military education which he received, may,
independently of any original bias of character, have laid
the foundation of the greatness to which he attained, and
of that mischievous application of unbridled power, through
which he fell very nearly to the level whence he first had
started. Nothing could be more corrupt than the morals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
of military society among the French before the Revolution&mdash;nothing
more selfish, or contracted, than the views
(at all times) of a thoroughbred military adventurer.</p>

<p>‘Buonaparte came into active life with as much (but we
have no reason to think a larger share of) lax morality
and pure selfishness as others of his age and calling. The
public crisis into which he was thrown, gave to profound
selfishness the form of insatiable ambition. With talents
and enterprise beyond all comparison greater than any
against which he had to contend, he overthrew whatever
opposed his progress. Thus, ambition in him was more
conspicuous than others, only because it was more successful.
He became a sovereign. How, then, was this pupil
of a military school prepared to exercise the functions of
sovereignty? An officer, as such, has no idea of divided
power. His patriotism is simply love of his troops and his
profession. He will obey commands&mdash;he will issue them&mdash;but,
in both cases, those commands are absolute. Talk
to him of deliberation, of debate, of freedom of action, of
speech, nay, of opinion&mdash;his <i>feeling</i> is, that the body to
which any of these privileges shall be accessible, must fall
into confusion, and be speedily destroyed.</p>

<p>‘Whatever pretexts may have been resorted to by
Buonaparte&mdash;whatever Jacobin yells he may have joined
in, to assist his own advance towards power&mdash;every subsequent
act of his life assures us, that the military prepossessions
in which he was educated, became those by which he
was influenced as a statesman; and we are well persuaded
of his conviction, that it was impossible for any country,
above all, for France, to be governed otherwise than by
one sole authority&mdash;undivided and unlimited. It may, we
confess, be no satisfaction to the French, nor any great
consolation to the rest of Europe, to know through what
means it was, or by what vicious training, that Buonaparte<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
was fitted, nay, predestined almost, to be a scourge and
destroyer of the rights of nations, instead of employing a
power irresistible, and which, in such a cause, none would
have felt disposed to resist, for the promotion of knowledge,
peace, and liberty throughout the world.</p>

<p>‘In hinting at what we conceive to be the fact, however,
we are bound by regard for truth; our business is
not to apologize for Buonaparte; but, so far as may be
done within the brief limits of a newspaper, to analyze, and
faithfully describe, him. The factions, also, which he was
compelled to crush, and whose overthrow obtained for him
the gratitude of his country, still threatened a resurrection
when the compressing force should be withdrawn. Hence
were pretexts furnished on behalf of despotism of which
men, more enlightened, and better constituted, than Buonaparte,
might not soon have discovered the fallacy. Raised to
empire at home, his ambition sought for itself fresh aliment;
and foreign conquest was at once tempting and easy.</p>

<p>‘Here the natural reflection will obtrude itself&mdash;what
might not this extraordinary being have effected for the
happiness of mankind, and for his own everlasting fame
and grandeur, had he used but a moiety of the force, or
perseverance, in generous efforts to relieve the oppressed
which he wasted in rendering himself the monopolist and
patron of oppression! But he had left himself no resource.
He had extinguished liberty in France, and had no hold
upon his subjects, but their love of military glory. Conquest,
therefore, succeeded to conquest, until nothing capable
of subjugation was left to be subdued. Insolence, and
rapacity, in the victor, produced, among the enslaved nations,
impatience of their misery, and a thirst for vengeance.
Injustice undermined itself, and Buonaparte, with his unseasoned
empire, fell together, the pageant of a day.</p>

<p>‘His military administration was marked by strict and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
impartial justice. He had the art, in an eminent degree,
of inciting the emulation, and gaining the affections of his
troops. He was steady and faithful in his friendships, and
not vindictive, on occasions where it was his power to be
so with impunity.</p>

<p>Of the deceased Emperor’s intellectual, and characteristic,
ascendency over men, all the French, and some of
the other nations besides the French, who had an opportunity
of approaching him, can bear witness. He seems to
have possessed the talent, not merely of command, but,
when he pleased, of conciliation and persuasion. With
regard to his religious sentiments, they were, perhaps, of
the same standard as those of other Frenchmen starting
into manhood at a time when Infidel writings had so
domineered over the popular mind, that revealed religion
was become a public laughing stock, and in a country
where the pure Christian faith was perplexed with subtilties,
overloaded with mummeries, and scandalized and discountenanced
by a general looseness of morals. Upon the
whole, Buonaparte will go down to posterity as a man, who,
having more good at his disposal than any other potentate
of any former age, had actually applied his immense means
to the production of a greater share of mischief and misery
to his fellow creatures&mdash;one who, on the basis of French
liberty, might have founded that of every other State
in Europe&mdash;but who carried on a series of aggressions
against foreign States to divert the minds of his own
subjects from the sense of their domestic slavery; thus
imposing on foreign nations a necessity for arming to shake
off his yoke, and affording to foreign despots a pretext for
following his example.</p>

<p>‘The sensation produced by the death of Buonaparte
will be a good deal confined, in this country, to its effects
as a partial relief to our finances, the expense of his custody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
at St. Helena being little short of 400,000<i>l.</i> per annum.
In France, the sentiment will be more deep and complex,
and, perhaps, not altogether easy to define. The practical
consequence of such an event may be remotely guessed at
by those who have had occasion to watch, in other Governments,
the difference between a living and an extinct
Pretender. A pretext for suspicion and severity in the
administration of affairs may be taken away by a Pretender’s
death; but then, a motive to moderation&mdash;a terror,
now and then salutary, of popular feelings being excited in
the Pretender’s favour by misgovernment&mdash;is, at the same
time, removed from the minds of reigning Princes. Buonaparte’s
son still lives, it is true; but how far he may ever
become an object of interest with any great party of the
French nation, is a point on which we will not speculate.’</p>

<p>The last individual memorial I can find of Napoleon,
in a popular form, was published by Hone in May 1821.
It is a black-edged sheet, having, as heading, profile portraits
of Napoleon, Maria Louisa, and the King of Rome,
and down the sides four full-length portraits of Napoleon.
It is <span class="locked">called:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>He put his foot on the neck of Kings, who would have put
their yokes upon the necks of the People: he scattered before
him with fiery execution, millions of hired slaves, who came at the
bidding of their Masters to deny the right of others to be free.
The monument of greatness and of Glory he erected, was raised
on ground forfeited again and again to humanity&mdash;it reared its
majestic front on the ruins of the shattered hopes and broken
faith of the common enemies of mankind. If he could not secure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
the freedom, peace, and happiness of his country, he made her a
terror to those who by sowing civil dissension, and exciting foreign
wars, would not let her enjoy those blessings. They who had
trampled upon Liberty could not at least triumph in her shame
and her despair, but themselves became objects of pity and derision.
Their determination to persist in extremity of wrong, only
brought on themselves repeated defeat, disaster, and dismay: the
accumulated aggressions their infuriated pride and disappointed
malice meditated against others, returned in just and aggravated
punishment upon themselves: they heaped coals of fire upon
their own heads: they drank deep and long, in gall and bitterness,
of the poisoned chalice they had prepared for others: the destruction
with which they had threatened a people daring to call
itself free, hung suspended over their heads, like a precipice, ready
to fall upon and crush them. ‘Awhile they stood abashed,’ abstracted
from their evil purposes, and felt how awful Freedom is,
its power how dreadful. Shrunk from the boasted pomp of royal
state into their littleness as men, defeated of their revenge, baulked
of their prey, their schemes stripped of their bloated pride, and
with nothing left but the deformity of their malice, not daring to
utter a syllable or move a finger, the lords of the earth, who had
looked upon men as of an inferior species, born for their use, and
devoted to be their slaves, turned an imploring eye to the People,
and with coward hearts and hollow tongues invoked the Name of
Liberty, thus to get the people once more within their unhallowed
grip, and to stifle the name of Liberty for ever.</p>

<p>He withstood the inroads of <i>Legitimacy</i>, this new Jaggernaut,
this foul Blatant Beast, as it strode forward to its prey over the
bodies and minds of a whole People, and put a ring in its nostrils,
breathing flame and blood, and led it in triumph, and played
with its crowns and sceptres, and wore them in its stead, and
tamed its crested pride, and made it a laughing stock and a
mockery to the nations. He, one man, did this, and as long as
he did this (how or for what end, is nothing to the magnitude of
this mighty question) he saved the human race from the last
ignominy, and that foul stain that had been so long intended, and
was at last, in an evil hour, and by evil hands, inflicted on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
If <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was a conqueror, he conquered the Grand Conspiracy
of <span class="smcap">Kings</span> against the abstract right of the Human Race to
be free. If he was ambitious, his greatness was not founded
on the unconditional, avowed surrender of the rights of human
nature. But, with him, the state of Man rose exalted too. If
he was arbitrary and a tyrant, first, France as a country was in
a state of military blockade, on garrison duty, and not to be
defended by mere paper bullets of the brain; secondly, but chief,
he was not, nor could he become, a tyrant by ‘right divine.’
Tyranny in him was not ‘sacred’: it was not eternal: it was not
instinctively bound in league of amity with other tyrannies: it
was not sanctioned by all ‘the laws of religion and Morality.’</p>

<p>Even his old enemy, George Cruikshank, whose peculiarly
impetuous temper had found a free vent in caricaturing
Napoleon, left off doing so when he was in safe keeping,
and only designed (in a publication called the ‘Omnibus’)
a ‘Monument to Napoleon’ when he died. In a note to
this design he says, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>‘As for me, who have skeletonised him
prematurely, paring down the prodigy even to his hat and
boots, I have but “carried out” a principle adopted almost
in my boyhood, for I can scarcely remember the time when
I did not take some patriotic pleasure in persecuting the
great enemy of England. Had he been less than that, I
should have felt compunction for my cruelties; having
tracked him through snow and through fire, by flood and
by field, insulting, degrading, and deriding him everywhere,
and putting him to several humiliating deaths. All that
time, however, he went on “overing” the Pyramids and
the Alps, as boys “over” posts, and playing at leapfrog
with the sovereigns of Europe, so as to kick a crown off at
every spring he made&mdash;together with many crowns, and
sovereigns, into my coffers. Deep, most deep, in a personal
view of matters, are my obligations to the agitator&mdash;but
what a debt the country <i>owes to him</i>!’</p>

reason of its being called the ‘Iron Crown’ is that, running round the centre
of the <i>interior</i> of the circle is a thin and narrow band of iron, which is supposed
to be manufactured from one of the nails used in the Crucifixion of our
Saviour, and given by St. Helena to her son Constantine as a talisman to

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
